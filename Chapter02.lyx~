\begin_layout Chapter
Background & Literature review
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to meet our research goal, some necessary knowledge on phishing
 in general is required.
 This chapter introduces a general understanding of phishing, an exploration
 of its damage in financial terms, the overview of its modus operandi, a
 brief explanation of types of phishing, general phishing countermeasures,
 and human factor in phishing attacks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
What is phishing?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the Internet has brought convenience to many people for exchanging
 information, it also provides opportunities for malicious behavior such
 as online fraud on a massive scale with little cost to the attackers.
 The attackers can manipulate the Internet users instead of the computer
 systems (hardware or software) that significantly increase the barriers
 of technological crime impact.
 Such human-centered attacks could be done by social engineering.
 According to Jakobsson et al., phishing is a form of social engineering
 that aims to gain trust from online users by mimicking trustworthy and
 legitimate institutions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

.
 Phishing has a similar basic principle to ‘fishing’ in the physical world.
 Instead of fish, online users are lured by authentic-looking communication
 and hooked by authentic-looking websites.
 Not only that, online users also may be lured by responding to a phishing
 email, either replying to or clicking on a hidden URL within its content.
 There are diverse definitions of phishing in our literature reviews.
 Therefore, we would like to discuss about its universal definition in a
 later section.
 However, one of the definitions of phishing, according to the Oxford Dictionary
, is as follows:
\end_layout

.
 An individual or a group who uses this technique is called 
\emph on
Phisher(s
\emph default
).
 After successfully obtaining sensitive information from the victim, phishers
 use this information to access victim’s financial accounts or to commit
 credit card fraud.
 However, to formalize the damage of phishing in term of money is a challenging
 task.
 We will briefly explore the cost of phishing attacks in a later section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The techniques or modus operandi of phishing may vary, but the most common
 is using fraudulent emails and websites 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "james:2005"

\end_inset

.
 A fraudulent website is designed in such a way that it may be identical
 to its legitimate target.
 However, a phishing website could also be completely different to its target
 as there is no level of identicalness.
 In the following subsections, we introduce how phishing was originally
 came about and how current literatures formally define phishing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The History 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The term "phishing" was first published by the 
\begin_inset Flex CT - acronym
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

AOL
\end_layout

\end_inset

 UseNet Newsgroup on January 2, 1996 and its use started to expand in 2004
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "phishorg"

\end_inset

.
 Since 1996, phishing has flourished.
 In 2004, total losses due to phishing reached more than U.S.$ 2 billion,
 and more than 15,000 sites were victims 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "fellman:2004"

\end_inset

.
 We discuss direct and indirect costs nowadays in a later section.
 Jakobsson et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006"

\end_inset

 mentioned that in the early years of the '90s (according to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "phishorg"

\end_inset

 it was around 1995) many hackers would create bogus AOL user accounts with
 automatically generated fraudulent credit card information.
 Their intention to give this fake credit card information was to simply
 pass the validity tests performed by AOL.
 By the time the tests were passed, AOL thought that these accounts were
 legitimate and thus activated them.
 Consequently, these hackers could freely access AOL resources until AOL
 tried to actually bill the credit card.
 AOL realized that these accounts were using invalid billing information
 and therefore deactivated the accounts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While creating false AOL user accounts with fake credit card information
 was not phishing, AOL's effort to counter these attacks led to the development
 of phishing.
 AOL's countermeasure including directly verifying the legitimacy of credit
 card information and the associated billing identity, forced hackers to
 pursue alternative ways 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006"

\end_inset

.
 Hackers masqueraded as AOL employees, asking other users for credit card
 information through AOL's instant messenger and email system 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "phishorg"

\end_inset

.
 Jakobsson et al.
 suggest that phishing attacks originated from this incident 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006"

\end_inset

.
 Since such attack had not been done before, many users fell victim to then.
 Eventually, AOL enforced warning systems to most of its customers to be
 vigilant when it comes to sensitive information 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "phishorg"

\end_inset

.
 To the present day, phishing attacks might not only be motivated by financial
 gain but also political reasons, and they emerged not only with AOL users,
 but also any online users.
 Consequently, large number of legitimate institutions such as PayPal and
 eBay are being spoofed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The universal definition 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before we begin to understand deeper about how and why phishing attack works,
 we briefly explore the common definition of phishing.
 Currently, there is no consensus definition, since almost every research
 paper, academic textbook or journal has its own definition of phishing
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006,james:2005,tally:2004,clayton:2005,parno:2006,jakobsson:2005,dhamija2006phishing"

\end_inset

.
 Phishing is also constantly evolving, so it might be very challenging to
 define its universal terminology.
 There are not so many studies that specifically address the standard of
 phishing definition.
 An exception is a piece of research conducted by Lastdrager 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "lastdrager:2014"

\end_inset

, which addressed a consensual definition of phishing.
 Before we decide upon one consensual phishing terminology, we will take
 a look at various phishing definitions from other sources:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "parno:2006"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is noteworthy that the definitions described by James et al., Tally et
 al., and Clayton et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "james:2005,tally:2004,clayton:2005"

\end_inset

 specify that the phishers only use email as a communication channel to
 trick potential victims.
 While it might be true because using email is greatly cost effective, we
 believe that phishing is not only characterized by one particular technological
 mean, as phishers can also use any other electronic communication to trick
 potential victims, such as private messages on online social networks.
 This definition is also similar to dictionary libraries 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "oxford,collins,merriam"

\end_inset

 that mention email as a medium communication between phishers and users.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We believe that the standard definition of phishing should be applicable
 to most phishing concepts that are presently defined.
 Consequently, a high level of abstraction is required to build a common
 definition of phishing.
 We are convinced that the formal definition of phishing should not focus
 on the technology that is being used but rather on the techniques of how
 the deception is being conducted, the method of an “act” if you will.
 Therefore, we follow the definition of phishing by Lastdrager 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "lastdrager:2014"

\end_inset

 which states that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\shape italic
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Phishing is a scalable act of deception whereby impersonation is used to
 obtain information from a target
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lastdrager 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "lastdrager:2014"

\end_inset

 states that to achieve this universal definition, a systematic review of
 literature up to August 2013 was conducted along with a manual peer review,
 which resulted in 113 distinct definitions to be analyzed.
 We thereby agree with Lastdrager 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "lastdrager:2014"

\end_inset

 that this definition addresses all the essential elements of phishing and
 we will adopt it as the universally accepted definition throughout our
 research.

The costs of phishing attacks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is a challenging task to find the real costs from phishing attacks in
 terms of money or direct costs.
 This is because the financial damage on banks is only known by the banks
 themselves and most institutions do not share this information with the
 public.
 Jakobsson et al.
 argue that the phishing economy is consistent with black market economy
 and does not advertise its successes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006"

\end_inset

.
 In this section, a brief explanation of direct and indirect costs of phishing
 attacks will be illustrated based on a literature review.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to Jakobsson et al., direct costs are depicted by the value of
 money or goods that are directly stolen through phishing attacks 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006"

\end_inset

.
 Indirect costs are the costs that do not represent the money or goods that
 are actually stolen, but the costs which have to be paid by the people
 who handle these attacks 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006"

\end_inset

, i.e.
 time, money and resources spent to reset people's passwords.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we mentioned earlier, it is difficult to assess the damage caused by
 phishing attacks on banks and institutions as they keep this information
 to themselves.
 Furthermore, many users are unwilling to acknowledge that they have fallen
 prey to phishing attacks.
 This happens because of fear of humiliation, financial loses, or legal
 liability

 cost of phishing attacks was up to $500 million losses in the US for the
 same year

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The lack of information such as a detailed documentation survey on how these
 numbers were found by Gartner group or Ponemon makes estimations more biased
 than is generally realized.
 It is interesting to investigate why their estimates are quoted without
 really analyzing their bias.
 One thing that comes to mind is that they might have a hidden agenda to
 make societies think that the cost of phishing is high.
 Consequently, people would be obliged to implement anti-phishing systems
 or engage in phishing awareness in their company, which requires money.
 With this in mind, we would like to emphasize that our findings on the
 costs of phishing attacks are only estimates without scrutiny from academic
 researchers, and they might be an exaggeration.
 Having said that, even if the cost of phishing attacks is zero, we believe
 that phishing is still a major problem in terms of trust among users and
 the misuse of email as a means of communication.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now consider how phishing attacks are carried out, and if there are distinct
 stages involved in the attacks? In the next section we review phishing's
 modus operandi in term of phishing stages or phases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Modus operandi
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we mentioned earlier, a phishing attack is a subset of identity theft.
 One modus operandi is first to create a fake website that spoofs legitimate
 website such as financial websites.
 These websites can be either identical or not identical to real websites;
 the aim is just to get a response from unsuspecting victims.
 After that, the phishers will try to trick the potential victim into submitting
 important information such as usernames, passwords and PINs through a fake
 website that they have created or through email reply from victims.
 With the information obtained, they will try to steal money from their
 victims, if the target institution is a bank.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Phishers employ a variety of techniques to trick potential victims to access
 their fraudulent website.
 One of the typical ways is by sending illicit emails on a large scale claiming
 to be from a legitimate institution.
 In the email content, they usually imitate an official-looking logo, using
 good business language style and often also forge the email headers to
 make it look like originating from legitimate institution.
 For example, the content of the email is to inform the user that the bank
 is changing its IT infrastructure, and request urgently that the customer
 should update their data with the consequence of loosing their money if
 the action does not take place.
 While there are various techniques of phishing attack, we address the common
 phases of phishing that we analyzed in a literature survey of several studies
 and we also address our own phishing phases.
 These phases are compiled in

, the first process is called 
\shape italic
Planning
\shape default
.
 In this process a phisher would usually do some reconnaissance on how would
 the attack is executed and what information would be obtained from the
 victim.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the second process, the phisher would think about the design of the email.
 This email is desired by the phisher to look as legitimate as possible
 to potential victim.
 For this purpose, target institutions' logos, trademarks, symbols, etc.
 are used to make the content look official to the victim.
 The author called this process as

 From the figure, we can spot a fake email by investigating the real sender
 email address by looking at the email header or the URL provided in the
 body, seeing whether it redirects to the official ING website or not.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the third process, the phisher 
\shape italic
fabricates
\shape default
 a story to make potential victims think that email is important.
 To achieve user attention, a phisher might build up a story about system
 upgrade, account hijacking or security enhancement so that the victim would
 feel obliged to be informed.
 Evidently, this technique corresponds with Cialdini 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "cialdini:2001"

\end_inset

, who suggests there are six principles to persuade people to comply with
 a request.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the fourth process, a phisher usually includes a 
\shape italic
threatening tone
\shape default
 or explain the urgency and consequences if the potential victim chooses
 not to take action desired by the phisher (e.g.
 account removal, account blocked).
 Consequently, users may fear for their account being deleted.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last process involves a fraudulent website that has been created by
 the phisher.
 Users may falsely believe the message given in the email and may click
 on a 
\begin_inset Flex CT - acronym

\begin_layout Plain Layout

URL
\end_layout

\end_inset

 that is embedded in the email.
 Subsequently, the URL redirects users to a 
\shape italic
spoofed website
\shape default
 which may request users' sensitive information.
 Furthermore, the website might be created to be as similar as possible
 to the target institution's website, so that potential victim may still
 believe that it is authentic.
 We will explain more about Cialdini's six basic tendencies of human behavior
 in generating positive response to persuasion

Considering that phishing attack is a process, Wetzel 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

 suggested a taxonomy to make sense of the complex nature of the problem
 by mapping out a common attacks lifecycle, and a possible set of activities
 attackers engage in within each phase.
 The taxonomy is illustrated in 
\begin_inset Flex CT - auto cross-reference

\begin_layout Plain Layout

.
 We speculate that Wetzel's taxonomy is not analogous with Frauenstein's
 main phishing processes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "frauenstein:2013"

\end_inset

.
 The difference is that Frauenstein et al.
 only focused on the design of the attack while Wetzel has added several
 phases like 
\shape italic
Collection

\shape italic
Fraud

 and

 Therefore, Wetzel's taxonomy is more holistic in term of phishing.

As we listed Wetzel's taxonomy in 
\begin_inset Flex CT - auto cross-reference

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

, we explain more of the taxonomy as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\shape italic
Planning
\shape default
: Preparation carried out by the phisher before continuing to the next phase.
 Example activities include identifying targets and victims and determining
 the method of the attack.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\shape italic
Setup
\shape default
: After the target, victim and the method are known, the phisher crafts
 a platform where the victim's information could be transmitted and stored,
 for example a fraudulent web- site/email.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\shape italic
Attack
\shape default
: Phisher distributes their fraudulent platform so that it can be delivered
 to the potential victims with fabricated stories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\shape italic
Collection
\shape default
: Phisher collects valuable information via response from the victims.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\shape italic
Fraud
\shape default
: Phisher abuses victim's information by impersonating the identity of the
 victim to the target.
 For example, A has gained B’s personal information to access C so that
 A can pose as B to access C.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\shape italic
Post-attack
\shape default
: After the phisher gained profit from the attack and abuse phases, they
 would not want to be noticed or detected by authority.
 Thus, the phisher might need to destroy evidence of the activities that
 he/she had undertaken.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As shown in 
\begin_inset Flex CT - auto cross-reference
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

tab:compilation-phases
\end_layout

\end_inset

, Tally et al.
 suggest that there are several phases involved in a phishing attack based
 on the attacker's point of view 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "tally:2004"

\end_inset

.
 The first phase represents the planning, where the attacker collects the
 email address of unsuspecting victims.
 The second phase, considering that it is related to creating a fake email
 that appears legitimate, can be viewed as design phase.
 We consider the third phase as the delivery and attack phases as it involves
 the attacker sending a fake email to the unintended victims and hiding
 the true source.
 The fourth phase represents attack phase as it involves with the recipient
 complying with the attacker’s request(s).
 Lastly, the fifth phase represents the fraud phase, as it related to the
 attacker harvesting and exploiting the victim's resources.
 Additionally, the phases described by Tally et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 are comparable with the information flow explained by Emigh

Based on our analysis by looking at the pattern of other phases from various
 sources, there is a major similarity between them.
 Therefore, we would like to define and design our own phase that are integrated
 with three key components suggested by Jakobsson et al.

It is important to know that in the phase 3, there are different scenarios
 such as: victim might be redirected to a spoofed website; victim may comply
 to reply the email; victim may comply to open an attachment(s); or victim
 may comply to call by phone.
 However, in 
\begin_inset Flex CT - auto cross-reference

 we have only illustrated the phases if the bait was using a spoofed website

\begin_layout Standard
We have reviewed various phases in phishing attacks, and from the review
 we have constructed our own phases.
 In the next section a brief introduction of the types of phishing is described.
 We believe that the general understanding of phishing types helps our main
 analysis to characterize phishing email properties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Types of phishing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In January 2014, the data of 8300 patients was compromised by US medical
 companies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "adam:2014"

\end_inset

.
 The data includes names, addresses, dates of birth and phone numbers.
 Other than demographic information, clinical information associated with
 this data was also stolen, including social security numbers.
 In April 2014, phishers successfully stole US$163,000 from a US public
 school based in Michigan 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ashley:2014"

\end_inset

.
 It is said that the email prompting the transfer of money came from the
 finance director of the school.
 In March 2014, Symantec discovered a phishing attack aimed at Google Drive
 users 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "teri:2014"

\end_inset

.
 The attack involved firstly an incoming email asking for the opening of
 document hosted at Google Docs.
 Users who clicked on the link were taken to a fraudulent Google login page
 that prompted Google users credentials.
 Interestingly, the URL seemed very convincing because it was hosted on
 Google's secure servers.
 We hypothesize that even more phishing incidents take place in the financial
 sector, but sometimes the news is kept hidden to maintain creditability.
 With this in mind, we believe fake websites might be hosted in the network
 that has more phishing domains than other networks.
 In the next section, we will discuss the general phishing countermeasures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One may ask: what types of phishing are there? What are the general types
 of phishing relevant to our research? Based on the cost of phishing attacks
 in 
\begin_inset Flex CT - auto cross-reference
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

sec:cost-of-phishing
\end_layout

\end_inset

, the threat of such attacks is alarming and might evolve in the future
 with more sophisticated technique of attacks.
 For this reason, it might be useful to provide a brief insight into popular
 variants of phishing that currently exist.
 We will briefly explain the types of phishing that are the most relevant
 to our research, based on the work of Jakobsson et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006"

\end_inset

.
 These types of phishing are strongly related to the phishing definition
 that we use, considering phishing is based on the act of deception by the
 phishers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Phishing based on visual similarities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since all phishing is based on deception and social engineering, there is
 a phishing scenario based on visual similarities.
 The typical scenario of phishing based on visual similarities is to send
 a large amount of illicit emails containing a call to action asking recipients
 to click embedded links 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006"

\end_inset

.
 These variations include cousin domain attacks.
 For example, there is a legitimate PayPal website addressed as wow.paypal.com.
 Cousin domain attacks confuse potential victims to believe that wow.paypal-secur
ity.com is a subdivision of the legitimate website due to similar-looking
 address.
 Similarly, homograph attacks create a confusion using similar characters
 to its addresses.
 For example, with wow.paypal.com and wow.paypa1.com, both addresses look the
 same but on the second link there is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

1
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

l
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, phishers may embed a login page directly to the email content.
 This suggests the elimination of the need of end-users to click on a link
 and phishers do not have to manage an active fraudulent website.
 IP addresses are often used instead of human readable host- names to redirect
 potential victim to phishing websites and JavaScript is used to take over
 the address bar of a browser to make potential victims believe that they
 are communicating with the legitimate institution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another type of deceptive phishing scheme is rock-phish attacks.
 They were held responsible for half of the reported phishing incidents
 worldwide in 2005
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "moore:2007"

\end_inset

.
 These attacks evade email filters by utilizing random text and GIF images
 that contain the actual message.
 Rock phish attacks also utilize a toolkit that is able to manage several
 fraudulent websites in a single domain.
 Sometimes, deceptive phishing schemes lead to installation of malware when
 users visit fraudulent website.
 We describe malware-based phishing schemes in the next section.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Malware-based phishing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generally, malware-based phishing refers to any type of phishing that involves
 installing malicious software onto users' personal computers 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006"

\end_inset

.
 Subsequently, this malware is used to gather confidential information from
 victims instead of spoofing legitimate websites.
 This type of phishing incorporates malwares such as keyloggers/screenloggers,
 web Trojans and hosts file poisoning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the next section, we study general phishing countermeasures in term of
 phishing detection and prevention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Current countermeasures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are various types of phishing countermeasures that are implemented
 at different levels.
 Purkait conducted an extensive research reviewing countermeasures available
 up until 2012 and analyzing their effectiveness 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "purkait"

\end_inset

.
 He suggests that there is a classification of phishing countermeasures
 into separate groups, as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Stop phishing at the email level
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Security and password management toolbars
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Restriction list
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_layout Itemize
Takedown, transaction anomaly detection, log files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Anti-phishing training
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Legal solutions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, Parmar et al.
 suggest that phishing detection can be classified into two types: user
 training approach and software classification approach 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "parmar:2014"

\end_inset

.
 They illustrate a diagram and a table that summarizes phishing detection
 as countermeasures in a broad view
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

.
 They also argue the advantages and disadvantages of each category 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "parmar:2014"

\end_inset

.
 However, as our research mainly focuses on an analysis of phishing emails
 based on Cialdini's six principles of persuasion 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "cialdini:2001"

\end_inset

, we briefly discuss the most relevant phishing countermeasures: restriction
 list group (e.g.
 Phishtank); machine learning approach (web-based phishing); properties
 or features in a phishing email; and anti-phishing training group (e.g.
 PhishGuru).
 In the last section of this chapter, we explore the human factor in phishing
 attacks, to see how phishing emails are engineered to gain the recipient's
 trust in order to get a response.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Phishing detection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this subsection, we conduct a literature review related to Phishtank
 as restriction list, and machine learning approach to detect spoofed websites
 as phishing detection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Phishtank
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the most common approaches to detect phishing attacks is the implementati
on of a restriction list.
 As the name suggest, it prevents users from visiting fraudulent websites.
 One of the efforts to achieve a restriction list is to derive phishing
 URLs from Phishtank.
 Phishtank is a blacklisting company specifically for phishing URLs and
 it is a free community web based where users can report, verify and track
 phishing URLs 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "phishtank"

\end_inset

.
 Phishtank stores phishing URLs in its database and is widely available
 for use by other companies for creating restriction lists.
 Some of the big companies that use Phishtank's data are: Yahoo Mail, McAfee,
 APWG, Web Of Trust, Kaspersky, Opera and Avira.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we discuss what current literatures deal with phishing
 data provided by Phishtank.
 The first step to getting a list of relevant literatures is by a keyword
 search in the Scopus online library.
 Putting 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Phishtank
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as a keyword search results in 12 pieces of literature.
 The next step is to read all the abstracts and conclusions of the resulting
 keyword search.
 We decided that 11 pieces of literatures were relevant to our research.

 For example, in the case of individual wealth in a country, 80% of all
 wealth is controlled by 20% of the population.
 It makes sense that in Phishtank's verification system, a single highly
 active user's action can greatly impact the system's overall accuracy.

 Moreover, there are some ways to disrupt the Phishtank verification system,
 such as: submitting invalid reports accusing legitimate websites; voting
 legitimate websites as phish; and voting illegitimate website as not phish.
 While all the scenarios described are for the phishers' benefit, the last
 scenario is more direct and the first two actions are a more subtle method,
 intended to undermine Phishtank's credibility.

\begin_layout Standard
To put it briefly, the lesson of crowd-sourced anti-phishing technology
 such as Phishtank is that the distribution of user participation matters.
 It means that if a few high value participants do something wrong, it can
 greatly impact the overall system 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Also, there is a high probability that bad users could extensively participate
 in submitting or verifying URLs in Phishtank.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Machine learning approach in detecting spoofed website
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fundamental task of a phishing detection system is to distinguish between
 phishing websites and legitimate ones.
 As we previously discussed, the aim of phishing attacks is to gather confidenti
al information from potential victims.
 To do this, phishers often prompt for this information through fraudulent
 websites and masquerade as legitimate institutions.
 It does not make sense if phishers created them in a way very distinctive
 from its target.
 It may raise suspicions with the result of unsuccessful attack.
 To put it another way, we speculate that most phishing websites are mostly
 identical to legitimate websites to reduce suspicion of potential victims.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast to one of the blacklisting technique we saw in Phishtank that
 heavily depend on human verification, researchers make use of machine learning
 based technique to automatically distinguish between phishing and legitimate
 websites and email.
 Basically, machine-learning system is a platform that can learn from previous
 data and predict future data with its classification: in this case, phishing
 and legitimate.
 In order for this machine to learn from data, there should be some kind
 of inputs to classify the data, which are called features or characteristics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, there are several learning algorithms to classify the data,
 such as logistic regression, random forest, neural networks and support
 vector machines.
 As this particular topic is outside the scope of our research, we do not
 discuss the learning algorithm that is currently implemented.
 We limit ourselves to introducing three features that are used in machine
 learning based detection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are vast amount of features that can be used in machine learning to
 detect phishing attacks.
 Literature was selected by keyword search such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

phishing + detection + machine learning
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 We analyzed three features: lexical feature, host-based feature and site
 popularity feature.
 Each of these features are introduced briefly below:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Lexical features
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lexical features (URL-based features) are based on the analysis of URL structure
 without any external information.
 Ma et al.
 suggest that the structure URL of phishing may “look” different to experts
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ma:2009"

\end_inset

.
 These features include how many dots exist, the length, how deep the path
 traversal the URL has, or if there any sensitive words present in a URL.
 For example, with the URLs https://wow.paypal.com and http://wow.paypal.com.example.c
om/ or http://login.example.com/ wow.paypal.com/, we can see that the domain
 paypal.com is positioned differently, with the first one being the benign
 URL.
 Le et al.
 suggest we can extract the features related to the full URL, domain name,
 directory, file name and argument 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "le:2011"

\end_inset

.
 For example, if we want to extract features related to the full URL, we
 can define the length of the URL, the number of dots in the URL, and whether
 the blacklisted word presents in the URL.
 The blacklisted words consist of sensitive words such as confirm, account,
 login or webscr.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lexical features analysis may have performance advantage and reduces overhead
 in term of processing and latency, since it only tells the machine to learn
 URL structure.
 90% accuracy is achieved when utilizing lexical features combined with
 external features such as WHOIS data 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "le:2011"

\end_inset

.
 Egan et al.
 conducted an evaluation of lightweight classification that includes lexical
 features and host-based features in its model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "egan:2011"

\end_inset

.
 The study found that the classification based on these features resulted
 in extremely high accuracy and low overheads.

\end_inset

 lists the existing lexical features that are currently implemented by two

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "xiang:2011,liu"

\end_inset

.
 However, Xiang et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "xiang:2011"

\end_inset

 pointed out that URL structure can be manipulated with little cost, causing
 the features to fail.
 For example, attackers could simply remove the embedded domain and sensitive
 words to make their phishing URLs look legitimate.
 Embedded domain feature examines whether a domain or a hostname is present
 in the path segment 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "xiang:2011"

\end_inset

, for example, http://wow.example.net/pathto/wow.paypal.com.
 Suspicious URL features examine whether the URL has 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

@
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

-
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, the present of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

@
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is examined in a URL because when the symbol 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

@
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is used, the string to the left will be discarded.
 Furthermore, according to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "xiang:2011"

\end_inset

, not many legitimate websites use 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

-
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in their URLs.
 .
 There are also plenty of legitimate domains presented only with IP address
 and contains more dots.
 Nevertheless, lexical analysis would be suitable to use for first phase
 analysis of large amounts of data

Each of these features matters for phishing detection.
 However, as our main objective is an analysis of phishing emails based
 on Cialdini's persuasion principles, we do not describe each of these fea-
 tures in detail.
 It is noteworthy that some of the features are subset of other features.
 For instance, autonomous system number (ASN), IP country and number of
 registration information are derived from WHOIS information.
 Nevertheless, we only explain the few of them that we consider the most
 crucial:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
WHOIS information: Since phishing websites and hacked domains are often
 created at a relatively young age, this information could provide the registrat
ion date, update date and expiration date.
 Domain ownership would also be included; therefore, a set of malicious
 websites with the same individual could be identified.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
2.
 IP address information: Justin Ma et al.
 used this information to identify whether or not an IP address is blacklisted
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ma2:2009,ma:2009"

\end_inset

.
 Besides the corresponding IP address, it provides records like nameservers
 and mail exchange servers.
 This allows the classifier to be able to flag other IP addresses within
 the same IP prefix and ASN.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Domain name properties: these include time to live (TTL) of DNS associated
 with a hostname.
 PTR record (reverse DNS lookup) of a domain could also be derived whether
 it is valid or not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Site popularity features
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Site popularity could be an indicator whether a website is phishy or not.
 It makes sense if a phishing website has much less traffic or popularity
 than a legitimate website.
