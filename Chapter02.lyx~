Background & Literature review
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the Internet has brought convenience to many people for exchanging
 information, it also provides opportunities to carry malicious behavior
 such as online fraud on massive scale with a little cost to the attackers.
 The attackers can manipulate the Internet users instead of computer system
 (hardware or software) that significantly increase the barriers of technologica
l crime impact.
 Such human centered attacks could be done by social engineering.
 Phishing is a form of social engineering that aim

 to retrieve credential from online users by mimicking trustworthy and legitimat
e institutions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

.
 These fraudulent attacks are most frequently done by electronic communication
 such as emails to direct users to fake websites and prompt for sensitive
 information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This chapter provides an overview to phishing modus operandi and its current
 countermeasures such as detection and prevention techniques along with
 a brief exploration of direct and indirect cost of phishing attacks.

\begin_layout Section
What is phishing?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Phishing has a similar basic principle as ‘fishing’ in the physical world.
 Instead of fish, online users are lured by authentic looking communication
 and hooked by authentic looking websites.
 Not only that, online users also may be lured by respond to a phishing
 email, either replying or clicking an obfuscated link within its content.
 There are diverse definitions of phishing in our literature reviews, therefore,
 we would like to discuss about its universal definition in later section.
 However, one of phishing definitions accoding to Oxford dictionary:
\end_layout

 companies in order to induce individuals to reveal personal information,
 such as passwords and credit card numbers, online

 An individual or a group who uses this technique is called 
\emph on
Phisher(s

).
 After successfully gaining a sensitive information from the victim, phishers
 use this information to access victim’s financial accounts or committing
 credit card frauds.
 The technique of phishing may vary, but the most common technique of phishing
 attacks done by using fraudulent emails and websites 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "james:2005"

\end_inset

.
 A fraudulent website is designed in such a way that it may be identical
 to its legitimate target.
 While it may be true, phishing website also could be completely different
 with its target as there is no level of identicalness.
 However, Preliminary analysis on what changed or added in phishing website
 would be conducted in the later section.

\begin_layout Subsection
The History 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first time the term "phishing" was published by the 
\begin_inset Flex CT - acronym
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

AOL
\end_layout

\end_inset

 UseNet Newsgroup on January 2, 1996 and was started to expand in 2004 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "phishorg"

\end_inset

.
 Since then, we considered phishing development in cyberspace has been flourishi
ng by phishers to make profit.
 Total losses due to phishing in 2004 reached more than U.S.
 $ 2 billion, it was involving more than 15,000 sites that become victims
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "fellman:2004"

\end_inset

.
 We will try to discuss about direct and indirect cost at present days in
 the later section.
 Evidently, Jakobsson, et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006"

\end_inset

 mentioned that in the early years of 90’s (according to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "phishorg"

\end_inset

 it was around 1995) many hackers would create bogus AOL user accounts with
 automatically generated fraudulent credit card information.
 Their intention to give this fake credit card information was to simply
 pass the validity tests performed by AOL.
 By the time the tests were passed, AOL was thinking that these accounts
 were legitimate and resulted to activate them.
 Consequently, these hackers could freely access AOL resources until AOL
 tried to actually bill the credit card.
 AOL realized that these accounts were using invalid billing information,
 thus deactivated the account.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While creating false AOL user accounts with fake credit card information
 was not exactly phishing attacks, but AOL’s effort to counter against the
 attacks was leading to development of phishing.
 This countermeasure includes directly verifying the legitimacy of credit
 card information and the associated billing identity, forced hackers to
 pursue alternative way 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006"

\end_inset

.
 Hackers were masquerading as AOL’s employees asking to other users for
 credit card information through AOL instant messenger and email system
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "phishorg"

\end_inset

.
 Jakobsson et al.
 suggest that phishing attacks were originating from this incident 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006"

\end_inset

.
 Since such attack has not been done before, many of users have been victimized
 by then.
 Eventually, AOL enforced warning system to the most of its customers to
 be vigilant when it comes to sensitive information 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "phishorg"

\end_inset

.
 At the present day, phishing attacks might not only being motivated by
 financial gain but also political reason, and they have been emerging not
 only aim to AOL users, but also any online users.
 Consequently, large number of legitimate institutions such as PayPal and
 eBay are being spoofed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The universal definition 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before we begin to understand deeper about how and why phishing attack works,
 we will briefly explore common phishing definition.
 Currently, there is no consensus definition, since almost in every research
 papers, academic textbook or journals has its own definition of phishing
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006,james:2005,tally:2004,clayton:2005,parno:2006,jakobsson:2005,dhamija2006phishing"

\end_inset

.
 Phishing is also constantly evolving, so it might be very challenging to
 define its universal terminology.
 There is not so much study that specifically addresses the standard of
 phishing definition.
 However, one research conducted by Lastdrager 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "lastdrager:2014"

\end_inset

 addressed to achieve consensual definition of phishing.
 Before we comply with one consensual phishing terminology, we will take
 a look at various phishing definitions from other sources:
\end_layout

\emph default
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is noteworthy that the definition described by James, et al, Tally, et
 al, and Clayton, et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "james:2005,tally:2004,clayton:2005"

\end_inset

 specifies that the phishers only use email as a communication channel to
 trick potential victims.
 While it might be true because using email would greatly cost effective,
 but we believe that phishing is not only characterized by one particular
 technological mean, as phishers can also use any other electronic communication
 to trick potential victims (i.e private message on online social network).
 This definition is also similar to dictionary libraries 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "oxford,collins,merriam"

\end_inset

 that mention email as a medium communication between phishers and users.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We believe that standard definition of phishing should be applicable in
 most of phishing concept that are presently defined.
 Consequently, the high level of abstraction and is required to build common
 definition on phishing.
 We also argued that the definition of phishing should not focus on the
 technology being used but rather on the methodology how the deception being
 conducted, an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

act
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 if you will.
 Therefore, We follow the definition of phishing by Lastdrager 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "lastdrager:2014"

\end_inset

 which stated: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to Lastdrager 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "lastdrager:2014"

\end_inset

, to achieve this universal definition, a systematic review of literature
 up to August 2013 was conducted along with manual peer review, which resulted
 in 113 distinct definitions to be analyzed.
 We thereby agree with Lastdrager 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "lastdrager:2014"

\end_inset

 that this definition addresses all the essential elements of phishing and
 we will adopt it as universally accepted terminology throughout our research.

The costs of phishing attacks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is a challenging task to find a real cost from phishing attacks in term
 of money or direct cost.
 This due to financial damage for bank is only known by banks and most instituti
ons do not share this information with the public.
 Evidently, Jakobsson et al.
 argue that phishing economy is consistent with black market economy and
 does not advertise its successes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006"

\end_inset

.
 On this section, a brief explanation of direct and indirect cost on phishing
 attack will be illustrated based on literature reviews.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to Jakobsson et al., direct cost is depicted by the value of money
 or goods that are directly stolen through phishing attack 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006"

\end_inset

.
 While indirect cost is the costs that do not represent the money nor goods
 that are actually stolen, but it is the costs has to be paid by the people
 who handle these attacks 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006"

\end_inset

 (i.e.
 time, money and resources spent to reset people password).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we mentioned earlier, the difficulty of assessing the damage on phishing
 attacks is caused by banks and institutions that keep this information
 themselves and the unwillingness of many users to share to acknowledge
 that they have been victimized by phishing attacks.
 This happens because of fear of humiliation, financial loses, or legal
 liability 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006"

\end_inset

.
 Evidently, studies estimate the damage ranging from $61 million 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "herley:2009"

\end_inset

 to $3 billion per year 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 losses of phishing attack to US banks and credit card companies for the
 year 2004

 By the 2007, it escalated to more than $3 billion loss

Modus operandi
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we mentioned earlier, Phishing attack is a form of cybercrime.
 The modus operandi usually carried out firstly by creating a fake website
 that spoofs legitimate website such as financial website, either identical
 or not identical as long as the phishers get responds from unsuspected
 victims.
 After that, the phishers will try to trick the potential victim to submit
 important information such as usernames, passwords, PINs, etc.
 through a fake website that they have created or through email reply from
 victims.
 With the information obtained, they will try to steal money from their
 victims if target institution is a bank.
 Phishers employ variety of techniques to trick potential victims to access
 their fraudulent website.
 One of the typical ways is by sending illicit email in a large scale claiming
 to be from legitimate institution.
 In the email content, they usually imitate an official-looking logo, using
 good business language style and often also forge the email headers to
 make it look like originating from legitimate institution.
 For example, the content of the email is to inform the user that the bank
 is changing its IT infrastructure, and request urgently that the customer
 should update their data with the consequence of loosing their money if
 the action does not take place.
 When the user click the link that was on the email message, they will be
 redirected to a fraudulent website, which will prompt the victim to fill
 in the details of their information.
 While there are various techniques of phishing attack, we will address
 the common phases of phishing that we analyzed by literature survey by
 several studies and also we will address our own phishing phases.
 These phases are compiled in

 On the second process, the phisher would think about the design of the

 This email is desired by the phisher to look as legit as possible to potential
 victim.
 For this purpose, target institutions logo, trademark, symbol, etc.
 are used to make the content look official to the victim.

 On the third process, the phisher 
\shape italic
fabricates
\shape default
 a story to make potential victim think that email is important.
 To achieve users attention, phisher might build up a story about system
 upgrade, account hijacked or security enhancement so that the victim would
 feel obliged to be informed.
 Evidently, this technique corresponds with Cialdini 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "cialdini:2001"

\end_inset

 that suggests there are six principles to persuade people to comply with
 a request.
 On the fourth process, a phisher usually include 
\shape italic
threatening tone
\shape default
 or explain the urgency and consequences if the potential victim chooses
 not to take action desired by the phisher (for example; account removal,
 account blocked, etc.).
 Consequently, users may fear of their account being deleted.
 The last process involved with fraudulent website that has been created
 by the phisher.
 Users may falsely believe to the message given in the email and may click
 a 
\begin_inset Flex CT - acronym

 that is embedded in the email.
 Subsequently, the URL would redirect users to a

 Furthermore, the website might be created to be as similar as possible
 to the target institution’s website, so that potential victim may still
 believe that it is authentic.

 For example, A has gained B's personal information to access C so that
 A can pose as B to access C.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\shape italic
Post-attack

Based on our analysis by looking at other phases from various sources, there
 is a major similarity between them.
 Therefore, we would like to define and design our own phase that are integrated
 with three key components suggested by Jakobsson, et al.

 These key components are include

In January 2014, 8300 patients data are being compromised in medical company
 in the US 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 The data includes names, addresses, date of birth and phone numbers were
 being stolen.
 Other than demographic information, clinical information associated with
 this data was also stolen, including social security numbers.
 In the April 2014, phishers have successfully stolen US$163,000 from US
 public school based on Michigan 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ashley:2014"

\end_inset

.
 It has been said that the email prompted to transfer money is coming from
 the finance director of the school.
 In March 2014, Symantec has discovered phishing attack aimed at Google
 drive users 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "teri:2014"

\end_inset

.
 The attack was carried firstly with incoming email asking for opening document
 hosted at Google docs.
 Users that have clicked on the link are taken to fraudulent Google login
 page prompted Google users credentials.
 Interestingly, the URL seems very convincing because it hosted on Google
 secure servers.
 We hypothesized that even more phishing incidents on financial area as
 well, but sometimes the news is kept hidden due to creditability reason.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One may ask, what type of phishing are these? What type of phishing commonly
 used nowadays? Evidently, based on the cost of phishing attacks in 
\begin_inset Flex CT - auto cross-reference
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

sec:cost-of-phishing
\end_layout

\end_inset

, the threat of phishing attacks is still alarming and might be evolving
 in the future with more sophisticated technique of attacks.
 For this reason, it might be useful to provide a brief insight on popular
 variants of phishing that currently exist.
 We will briefly explain the types of phishing which are the most relevant
 to our research based on Jakobsson, et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006"

\end_inset

.
 These types of phishing is strongly related to the phishing defintion that
 we used, because all phishing based act of deception by the phishers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Deceptive phishing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many variations based on deceptive phishing schemes.
 Typical scenario of deceptive phishing schemes is to send a large amount
 of illicit emails containing call to action asking recipients to click
 embedded links 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006"

\end_inset

.
 These variations include cousin domain attack.
 For example, legitimate PayPal website addressed as www.paypal.com, this
 cousin domain attacks confuse potential victims to believe that www.paypal-secur
ity.com is a subdivision of the legitimate website due to identical looking
 addresses.
 Similarly, homograph attacks create a confusion using similar characters
 to its addresses.
 For example, www.paypal.com and www.paypa1.com, both addresses look the same
 but on the second link, it uses “1” instead of “l”.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, phishers may embed a login page directly to the email content.
 This suggests the elimination of the need of end-users to click on a link
 and phishers do not have to manage an active fraudulent website.
 IP addresses are often used instead of human readable hostname to redirect
 potential victim to phishing website and JavaScript is used to take over
 address bar of a browser to make potential victims believe that they are
 communicating with the legitimate institution.
 We will also see few examples of malicious JavaScript on our preliminary
 analysis section.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another type of deceptive phishing scheme is rock-phish attacks.
 They held responsible for half a number of reported incidents worldwide
 in 2005 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "moore:2007"

\end_inset

.
 These attacks evade email filters by utilizes random text and GIF images
 which contain the actual message.
 Rock phish attacks also utilize a toolkit that capable to manage several
 fraudulent websites in a single domain.
 Sometimes, deceptive phishing schemes lead to installation of malware when
 users visit fraudulent website and we will describe malware based phishing
 scheme in the next section.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Malware-based phishing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generally, malware based phishing refers to any type of phishing which involves
 installing malicious piece of software onto users' personal computer 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006"

\end_inset

.
 Subsequently, this malware is used to gather confidential information from
 victims instead of spoofing legitimate websites.
 This type of phishing incorporates malwares such as keyloggers/screenloggers,
 web Trojans and hosts file poisoning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Bad neighborhoods on phishing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the physical world, there are parts of certain area that have higher
 crime rates than others (eg.
 Bronx in the US) which called hotspots.
 Evidently, it is statistically more likely that a crime will occur compared
 to other locations 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "moura:2013"

\end_inset

.
 To better illustrate this analogy, the police department in Belgium 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "belgiumpolice:2014"

\end_inset

 has put up statistical information regarding crime rates in the country.
 
\begin_inset Flex CT - auto cross-reference

\begin_layout Plain Layout

fig:car-incidents
\end_layout

\end_inset

 shows an example in 2013; there were up to 5525 car theft incidents recorded
 and we can see there are certain areas that have higher probability that
 a car got stolen.
 For example, Antwerp had 415 incidents whereas Berlare had only 1 car theft
 incident 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "belgiumpolice2:2014"

\end_inset

.
 The data is not necessarily based on cities, it can be based on the residential
 area within a city.
 This holds true that much higher crime rates in a concentrated location
 compared to any other locations.
 It is called bad neighborhood.

 suggest that Internet Badhoods do not always only based on network prefixes
 level (e.g.
 /24, /32, etc..) but it can be aggregated into several levels (ISPs, Countries)

 Moreover, Internet Badhoods may vary depending on which application exploited.
 While spam is most likely distributed all around the world, however, phishing
 Badhoods are most likely concentrated in developed countries (e.g.
 US)

 This suggests that phishing sites are required to have more reliable hosts
 in term of availability, while spams are not.

Current countermeasures of phishing attacks

\begin_layout Standard
There are various types of phishing countermeasures that implemented in
 different levels.
 Purkait has conducted an extensive research in reviewing these countermeasures
 which are available up until 2012 and their effectiveness 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 He suggests that there is a classification of phishing countermeasures
 in separate groups and according to Purkait 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, these groups are listed as follow:
\end_layout

 He illustrated a diagram and a table that summarizes phishing detection

 They also argued the advantages and disadavantages of each category

Phishtank
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the common approaches to detect phishing attacks is the implementation
 of restriction list.
 As the name suggest, it prevents users to visit fraudulent websites.
 One of the efforts to achieve restriction list, is to derive phishing URLs
 from Phishtank.
 Phishtank is a blacklisting company specifically for phishing URLs and
 it is a free community web based where users can report, verify and track
 phishing URLs 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "phishtank"

\end_inset

.
 Phishtank stores phishing URLs in its database and is widely available
 for use by other companies for creating resriction list.
 Some of the big companies that are using Phishtank’s data includes; Yahoo
 Mail, McAfee, APWG, Web Of Trust, Kaspersky, Opera and Avira.
 In this section, we will discuss how the current literatures have to do
 with phish data provided by Phishtank.
 The first step to achieve the list of relevant literatures regarding phishtank
 is by keyword search in Scopus online library.
 By putting 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Phishtank
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as a keyword search, it results in 12 literatures.
 The next step, we read the all the abstracts and conclusions of the resulting
 keyword search and we decided 11 literatures that are relevant to our research.

 For example, in the case of individual weatlh in a country, 80% of the
 all wealth is controlled by 20% of population in a country.

 Moreover, there are some ways to disrupt Phishtank verification system;
 submitting invalid reports accusing legitimate website, voting legitimate
 website as phish, and voting illegitimate website as not phish.
 While all the scenarios described are for the phishers' benefit, the last
 scenario is more direct and the first two actions rather subtle intention
 to undermine Phishtank credibility.

To put it briefly, the lesson of crowd sourced anti-phishing technology
 such as Phishtank is that the distribution of user participation matters.
 It means that if a few high value participants do something wrong, it can
 greatly impact overall system

 Also, there is a high probability that bad users could also extensively

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Machine learning approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fundamental of phishing detection system would be to distinguish between
 phishing websites and the legitimate ones.
 As we previously discussed, the aim of phishing attack is to gather confidentia
l information from potential victims.
 To do this, phishers often prompt for this information through fraudulent
 websites and masquerade as legitimate institutions.
 It does not make sense if phishers created them in a way very distinctive
 with its target.
 It may raise suspicions with result of unsuccessful attack.
 To put it another way, while it might be true, we speculated that most
 of the phishing websites are mostly identical with its legitimate websites
 as target to reduce suspiciousness from potential victim.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast of one of blacklisting technique we saw in Phishtank that heavily
 depend on human verification, researchers make use of machine learning
 based technique to automatically distinguish between phishing and legitimate
 either websites or email.
 Basically, machine-learning system is a platform that can learn from previous
 data and predict future data with its classification, in this case, phishing
 and legitimate.
 In order for this machine to learn from data, there should be some kind
 of inputs to classify the data, it is called features or characteristics.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, there are also several learning algorithms to classify the
 data, such as, logistic regression, random forest, neural networks and
 support vector machine.
 However, for the sake of simplicit of our research, we will not discuss
 about the learning algorithm that is currently implemented.
 We will only introduce three features that are used in machine learning
 based detection.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are vast amount of features to utilize machine learning to detect
 phishing attack.
 Literatures are selected by keyword search such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

phishing + detection + machine learning
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 We analyze three features: lexical feature, host-based feature and site
 popularity feature.
 Each of these features will be introduced briefly as follows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Lexical features
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lexical features (URL based features) are based on the analysis of URL structure
 without any external information.
 Ma, et al.
 suggest that the structure URL of phishing may “look” different to experts
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ma:2009"

\end_inset

.
 These features include how many dots exist, the length, how deep the path
 traversal do the URL has or if there any sensitive words present in a URL.
 For example the URLs https://www.paypal.com and http://www.paypal.com.example.com/
 or http://login.example.com/ www.paypal.com/, we can see that the domain paypal.com
 positioned differently, with the first one being the benign URL.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lexical features analysis may have performance advantage and reduces overhead
 in term of processing and latency, since it only tells the machine to learn
 URL structure.
 90% accuracy is achieved when utilizing lexical features combined with
 external features such as WHOIS data 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "le:2011"

\end_inset

.
 Egan, et al.
 conducted an evaluation of lightweight classification that includes lexical
 features and host based features in its model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "egan:2011"

\end_inset

.
 The study found that the classification based on these features resulted
 in extremely high accuracy and low overhead.

 lists the existing lexical features that are currently implemented by two

\end_inset

.
 However, Xiang, et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "xiang:2011"

\end_inset

 pointed out that URLs structure could be manipulated with little cost,
 causing the features to fail.
 For example, attackers could simply remove embedded domain and sensitive
 words to make their phishing URLs look legitimate.
 Embedded domain feature examines whether a domain or a hostname is present
 in the path segment 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "xiang:2011"

\end_inset

, for example, http://www.example.net/pathto/www.paypal.com.
 Suspicious URL feature examine whether the URL has 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

@
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

-
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, the present of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

@
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is examined in a URL because when the symbol 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

@
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is used, the string to the left will be discarded.
 Furthermore, according to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "xiang:2011"

\end_inset

, not many legitimate websites use 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

-
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in their URLs.
 There are also plenty of legitimate domains presented only with IP address
 and contains more dots.
 Nevertheless, lexical analysis would be suitable features to use for first
 phase analysis in a large data

\begin_layout Standard
Each of these features does matter for phishing detection.
 However, as our main objective is synthesizing cialdini's principle with
 phishing emails, we will not describe each of these features in detail.
 It is noteworthy that some of the features are subset of another feature,
 for instance, autonomous system number (ASN), IP country and number of
 registration information are derived from WHOIS information.
 Nevertheless, we will only explain few of them that we assume the most
 crucial.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
WHOIS information: Since phishing websites and hacked domains are often
 created at relatively young age, this information could provide the registratio
n date, update date and expiration date.
 Domain ownership would also be included; therefore, a set of malicious
 websites with the same individual could be identified.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
IP address information: Justin Ma, et al.
 used this information for identify whether or not an IP address is in blacklist
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ma2:2009,ma:2009"

\end_inset

.
 Besides the corresponding IP address, it provides records like nameservers
 and mail exchange servers.
 This allows the classifier to be able to flag other IP addresses within
 the same IP prefix and ASN.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Domain name properties: these include time to live (TTL) of DNS associated
 with a hostname.
 PTR record (reverse DNS lookup) of a domain could also be derived whether
 it is valid or not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Site popularity features
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Site popularity could be an indicator whether a website is phishy or not.
 It makes sense if a phishing website has much less traffic or popularity
 than a legitimate website.

 Evidently, they indicated that even after 28 days after training, users
 trained by PhishGuru were less likely to click the link presented in the
 simulated phishing email than those who were not trained.
 They also find that users who trained twice were less likely to give informatio
n to simulated fraudulent website than users who were trained once.
 Moreover, they argue that the training does not decrease the users’ willingness
 to click on the links from legitimate emails; it means that less likely
 a trained user did a false positive when he or she requested to give informatio
n from true legitimate emails
