\begin_layout Standard
First and foremost, I would like use this opportunity to thank both of my
 supervisors, Prof.
 Dr.
 Pieter Hartel and Elmer Lastdrager MSc.
 I am thankful for their unrelenting guidance and support that have made
 this research possible.
 They have exceeded beyond the expected duties as supervisors and help me
 to make this master thesis possible.
 They have provided me with invaluably constructive thoughts and critical
 feedback.
 I am sincerely grateful to them for sharing their truthful and illuminating
 views on a number of issues related to the research.
 It was Elmer's vision to integrate phishing emails corpus with cialdini's
 principles as the core of my research.
 He has assisted me in obtaining the data from

A special thanks to Eyla who has incented me to strive towards my goal and
 for being there in difficult times.
 All my friends, Aldi, Vignesh, Hasib, Saud, and all the others who supported

 Without all their supports, accomplishing my studies would not have been
 possible.
