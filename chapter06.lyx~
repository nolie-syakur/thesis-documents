Discussion & Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the previous chapter , we have addressed the results of our study in
 considerable detail.
 Now in this chapter, we look at how our findings answer our research questions
 and whether the findings are consistent with the hypotheses we described
 in

\begin_layout Standard
Before we conclude our main analyses, we would like to mention the bottom
 line of our preliminary investigation on phishing bad neighborhood and
 the differences between phishing vs original.
 Our data suggests that there are some possibilities of phishing bad neighborhoo
d (10% hacked, 35% higher possibilities, 55% less possibilies), there are
 much more legitimate domains that are exist.
 When we look at phishing vs original analysis, it suggests 87% of the total
 HTML codes are maintaining the appearance closer as the target while 12.5%
 are completely different with its target.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our research was aimed to synthesize persuasive principles and characterize
 phishing email properties.
 We looked at what are the properties of phishing email and how relevant
 are the persuasive principles to its generic properties.
 The data was obtained from fraudehelpdesk as national institution based
 in Netherlands that handles reports on fraud including phishing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was a challenging task to manually code individual phishing email to
 fit onto our dataset.
 Our experience tells us that any researcher who wishes to work related
 with phishing email and persuasion principles as related to human psychology,
 should devote a lot of time in preparing adequately for the project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another aspect of our research was that persuasive principle has variety
 of strength in respect of influence depending on the individual person.
 Thus we have addressed our rationale in synthesizing persuasive principles
 on phishing emails.
 In addition, persuasion technique as a social engineering has been and
 remains successful in exploiting human factor vulnerability in order to
 influence people to have a positive response in favor of the person who
 requested it.
 Yet, it is almost absent from the computing literature perspective

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at our results on the characteristics of reported phishing emails,
 we found that 36.2% of total phish include attachment while 63.8% of them
 do not include attachment(s).
 From chi-square tests result, we conclude that both ZIP attachment and
 HTML attachment have a highly significant association when a phish email
 includes attachment(s).
 From the total amount of 207 unique phishing emails, we found that requesting
 to click URL is the most prevalent method at more than half of the total
 phish as oppose to request to call by phone at less than 5% of the total.
 When we look at the content characteristics of the phish, most of it utilizes
 HTML code as modern email clients are able to read HTML based content email.
 Similarly, URL presence in our analysis also significantly higher at more
 than half of the total phish.
 It is notable that content variables may overlap with each other.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we look at the target sector statistics of phishing mails, we find
 that financial as the most targeted sector to be impersonated by phishers
 at 37.7% of the total phish.
 In addition, E-commerce/retails took the second place of the most targeted
 sector at 19.3% of the total phish.
 This finding congruent with our expectation that phishers tend to impersonate
 financial institutions.
 Furthermore, when we look at the characteristic of the reasons being used
 in phishing emails, account related contributes the most frequent reason
 than others at 48.8% of the total phish.
 When we look at the persuasion principles, the analysis suggests that authority
 principle contributes the most prevalent principle at 96.1% followed by
 scarcity principle at 41% of the total phish.
 On the other hand, social proof and reciprocation contributes less prevalent
 principles.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at our results, we conclude that when URL(s) is present in a phishing
 email, it will likely to be obfuscated and requested by the phisher.
 Similarly, when an attachment(s) is included, it will likely to be requested
 by the phisher.
 Although it seems negligible, it is interesting to know that there are
 several cases when phisher only include an attachment(s) without requesting
 to open it.
 Our investigation on account related reason and URL presence resulted in
 highly significant relationship between these two properties.
 It means that when a phishing email is about account related reason, there
 is a higher chance that it includes URL(s).
 In addition of the relationship between generic properties, our analsys
 suggests that when a phishing mail which targeting government, will likely
 to have document related reason.
 Similarly, when a phishing email has document related reason, it will likely
 to include an attachment(s).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we look at how relevant are the persuasive principles to phishing email
 properties, we find that 100% government targeted emails are having authority
 principle and 95.9% of non government targeted email are also having authority
 principle.
 Our data suggests that there is no significant association between government
 targeted email and authority principle.
 Similarly, administrator and non administrator targeted emails are both
 high in respect to authority principle.
 Moreover, our result on authority principle and image(s) presence in a
 phishing email suggests that there is no association between these two
 variables.
 This indicates that authority is indeed a dominating principle and have
 higher chance to be the main technique of a phishing email.
 When we look at financial targeted sector and scarcity principle, we find
 that both financial and non financial targeted emails are less chance to
 have scarcity principle.
 Apart from our hypothesis related to financial sector and scarcity principle,
 if we look deeper, administrator targeted emails are likely to have scarcity
 principle.
 In contrary, non administrator targeted emails are less likely to have
 scarcity principle.
 When we look at account related phishing and scarcity, we find that there
 is a highly significant relationship between them.
 This means that if a phishing email involve in account related reason,
 the higher chance of scarcity principle as a persuasion technique.
 Our next finding for relationship between e-commerce/retails targeted emails
 indicates that this sector contributes less number of likeability principle
 as both e-commerce/retails and non-ecommerce/retails targeted emails have
 high number of non-likeability principle.
 Similarly, our data suggests that there are no significant association
 between social media targeted emails and social proof principle.
 However, we find that there is a significant relationship between the use
 of HTML and likeability principle, this suggests that likeability phishing
 email tend to use HTML code to persuade unsuspecting victim.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another observation on authority and scarcity principle suggests that there
 is no significant association between them, as both authoritative and non-autho
ritative emails contribute less percentage on scarcity principle.
 We have also observed whether likeability and consistency have a relationship,
 our data suggests that there is a significant association between them.
 Our result signifies that the higher likebility, the lower chance to have
 consistency principle.

Overall, although there are many hypotheses in respect of persuasion principles
 are rejected, some of them are accepted.
 This conclude low relevancy in respect between persuasion principles and
 generic properties of a phishing email.
 Our research sheds light on the involvement of persuasion principles as
 human factor and phishing email which has not been extensively studied.
