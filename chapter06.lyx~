At the beginning of our research, we stated two research questions that
 need to be answered.
 In this section, we discuss our findings to answer these research questions.

 Based on our findings, we can conclude the following points:

\begin_layout Itemize
Based on

\begin_layout Plain Layout

tab:Attachment(s)-analysis
\end_layout

\end_inset

, when attachment(s) are included in a phishing email, they are likely to
 be ZIP or HTML files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Requesting to click a URL(s) is the most prevalent instruction in phishing
 emails.

\begin_layout Itemize
As we illustrated in

\begin_layout Itemize
As we illustrated in 
\begin_inset Flex CT - auto cross-reference

It can be seen from 
\begin_inset Flex CT - auto cross-reference

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Flex CT - auto cross-reference

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 that phishers provide clear instructions on how recipients are meant to
 act; phishing emails that include attachment(s) are likely to include a
 request to open it and phishing emails which provide URL(s) are likely
 to request to click on it.

\begin_layout Itemize
Based on our finding in 
\begin_inset Flex CT - auto cross-reference

\begin_layout Itemize
As we illustrated in 
\begin_inset Flex CT - auto cross-reference

 to include attachment(s).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, it is worth pointing out that our finding on the detailed financial
 sector in 
\begin_inset Flex CT - auto cross-reference
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

fig:Detailed-of-financial
\end_layout

\end_inset

 indicates many of them are non-Dutch based financial institutions such
 as Bank of America, Barclays Bank, and Lloyds Bank.
 However, we found this is not ideal because our dataset came from a Dutch-based
 organization.
 Perhaps this is because we conducted the analysis only on 207 unique phishing
 emails in the English language, which is 2.45% of the total reported emails.
 We explain why we can only analyze 207 unique phishing emails in the English
 language in 
\begin_inset Flex CT - auto cross-reference

\begin_layout Plain Layout

sec:Limitation
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Despite this limitation, we emphasize that our current study can be seen
 as a precursor to a larger study of persuasion techniques and phishing
 emails in general.
 By this reasoning, our method or measure instruments such as algorithms,
 flowcharts, and variables would not be biasing the method to what we may
 find in the reported phishing emails in the Dutch language.

To what extent are the persuasion principles used in phishing emails?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To answer the second research question, we look at the relationships between
 the persuasion principles and the generic properties.
 With this in mind, we have established 10 hypotheses related to these relations
hips and we look whether the findings are consistent with these hypotheses.
 
\begin_inset Flex CT - auto cross-reference

\begin_layout Plain Layout

tab:Overview-of-verified
\end_layout

\end_inset

 summarizes the overview of verified hypotheses.
 Because almost all phishing emails use the authority principle, this implies
 all phishing email properties related to the authority principle resulted
 in no significant relationship.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we look at the targeted sector and scarcity principle, we find that
 both financial and non-financial targeted emails are less chance to have
 scarcity principle.
 Apart from our hypothesis related to the financial sector and scarcity
 principle, we see that administrator-targeted emails are likely to have
 scarcity principle.
 In contrast, non-administrator targeted emails are less likely to have
 scarcity principle.
 However, our findings suggest that the strength of association between
 administrator-targeted emails and the scarcity principle is weak.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next finding on the relationship between e-commerce/retail sector targeted
 emails indicates that this sector less employs the likeability principle
 as both e-commerce/retail sector and non- e-commerce/retail sector targeted
 emails have a high number featuring the non-likeability principle.
 Similarly, our data suggests that there are no significant association
 be-tween social media targeted emails and the social proof principle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our data suggests that there is a significant association between likeability
 and consistency.
 According to our findings, the higher the likeability, the lower the chance
 of featuring the consistency principle.
 This support our hypothesis that says that the occurrence of likeability
 will impact the occurrence of consistency.
 However, we find the strength of association between the variables is weak.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we look at account-related phishing and scarcity, we find that there
 is a highly significant relationship between them.
 This means that if a phishing email uses an account-related reason, it
 will likely use the scarcity principle as a persuasion technique.
 Moreover, the result suggests that account-related reasons and the scarcity
 principle have a strong relationship.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lastly, we find that there is a significant association between the use
 of HTML and the likeability principle.
 This suggests that likeability phishing emails tend to use HTML code to
 persuade unsuspecting victims.
 However, their strength of association is weak.

, we can answer our second research question with the following underlying
 perspectives:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The extensive use of authority as a persuasion technique in phishing emails
 as opposed to social proof technique.
 However, our analysis suggests that while the percentages are still high,
 authority principle is less likely to be used in individual target type
 and social reason type (see

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Depending on the target types and the reason types, three persuasion principles
 -- scarcity, consistency and likeability -- are the next most popular principle
s used in our dataset (see

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The scarcity principle will likely be used when phishing emails come from
 the administrator target type and account reason type (see

The likeability principle affects the usage of HTML-based email and consistency

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our research was aimed at understanding how phishing emails use persuasion
 techniques.
 The analysis consists of finding relationships between persuasion techniques
 and generic properties of phishing emails.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The findings may be influenced by the fact that only one person (the author)
 has coded the emails.
 Although we made a flowchart in 
\begin_inset Flex CT - auto cross-reference
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

fig:Flowchart-cialdini
\end_layout

\end_inset

 to model our decisions in terms of data coding, we believe persuasion technique
s are personal and difficult to find a consensual decision.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nevertheless, by using parameters and hypotheses in 
\begin_inset Flex CT - auto cross-reference
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

chap:research-questions
\end_layout

\end_inset

, we have been able to find the characteristics of phishing emails based
 on persuasion techniques.
 Our approach has proven useful in identifying critical characteristics
 and relationships between generic properties of phishing emails and persuasion
 techniques.
 Three important findings of our research are that: (1) authority is the
 most popular persuasion technique regardless of the target and the reason
 used; (2) depending on the target types and the reason types, the next
 most popular persuasion principles are scarcity, consistency and likeability;
 and (3) scarcity principle has a high involvement with administrator target
 type and account-related concerns.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we relate between target types and the reason used in phishing emails,
 our suggestions for preventing phishing can be described in the following
 points:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If we assume that most people are more likely to comply with authority,
 we suggest a legitimate institution should never use emails as a medium
 of communication with its customers.
 Instead, a legitimate institution should have its own secure messaging
 system to communicate with its customers.
 This may reduce the risk of costumers believing that phishing emails are
 real.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Even if a legitimate institution uses emails, they may use a simple email
 validation system such as Sender Policy Framework (SPF), which is designed
 to verify the sender’s email server before delivering all legitimate email
 to the intended recipients.
 This can prevent a spoofed email being delivered to the intended victim.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Legitimate institutions such as banks could use what its customers have,
 such as a phone number registered in the system or a token given by the
 bank to the customers.
 A secret code in the email sent by the bank should match the code delivered
 to the customer’s phone or token.
 This would provide a two-factor authentication and would make it more difficult
 for phishers to spoof bank emails.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It might be useful if security experts can create a library that contains
 the most common words or phrases that signify authority and scarcity principles
, so that incoming email could be filtered using the library.
 Our flowchart can be useful to help the development of the library so that
 the conventional phishing email detection can be improved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Our findings suggest that account-related is the most used reason in phishing
 emails.
 Therefore, we suggest that anti phishing filtering systems should also
 focus on detecting account-related emails to prevent them from being delivered
 to the intended victim.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Persuasion awareness in phishing emails is needed to help the end users
 think before they respond to an email, and to enhance users' ability to
 identify phishing emails.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, the reflection from this research is that the phishers are not
 only utilizing a technical strategy to trick the unsuspecting victims,
 but also persuasion principles to obtain positive responses from the victims.
 Our research exhibits an important aspect of phishing emails so that future
 phishing email countermeasures should not only be developed from a technical
 perspective but they should also be able to resist from persuasion misuse.
 Continued research on persuasion techniques in phishing emails is required
 to stay ahead of the phishers.
 Our method is a solid starting point in a real world analysis to identify
 the underlying issue in phishing emails.

Limitation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the research produced conclusive results, our findings need to
 be assimilated in the backdrop of some limitations that arose due to the
 complex nature of our methodology and the research environment.
 It is important for us to explain these limitations so that the readers
 can understand the findings of our research in the proper context.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first limitation is that we got the data from only one organization.
 Our study is totally dependent on the information documented by this organizati
on, and we do not know whether the sample data represents the Netherlands
 overall or represents a certain area or criterion.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second limitation is that sometimes the emails did not show the complete
 structures because the reporter forwarded a suspected phishing email as
 an attachment, which removes essential elements of it such as any attachment(s)
 included in the original email.
 This causes our study to be dependent on the reporter that reports to this
 organization as well.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third limitation is the language barrier.
 Few of the English-based phishing emails forwarded by the reporter had
 information in Dutch.
 It might be useful to know to understand the information provided by the
 reporter.
 Without understanding non-English language, we could also analyze the structura
l properties of phishing emails, such as whether the email uses HTML or
 whether it contain hidden URL.
 However, since our analysis was aimed at analyzing persuasion techniques
 in phishing emails, we need to have the language proficiency to know which
 persuasion techniques were used.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fourth limitation is that our data classification was done by one person.
 This means the coding of the data into associated variables could be inaccurate.
 While the data coding to the generic structural properties of phishing
 email could be justified, however, the data coding into the persuasion
 principles could be an issue in terms of accuracy.
 For example, one person can claim an email is attractive while another
 person can claim it is not.
 This introduces the greatest limitation to our research because it significantl
y impacts our results.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fifth limitation is the unique dataset of the reported phishing emails
 (440 phishing emails reduced to 207 unique phishing emails).
 This resulted in a smaller sample size of data and therefore it was a challengi
ng task to find associations using Pearson chi-square method.

Future work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A follow-up study to analyze phishing emails with Dutch language, which
 we did not observe, would be extremely desirable in order to test our findings.
 We feel that any future research along this line will find our work to
 be a useful starting point.
 Furthermore, we also recommend adding resilient validation in data classificati
on in terms of persuasion principles by involving several people to have
 an objective decision.
 It is also interesting to identify the authority principle in regular emails
 to make an objective perspective and compare with phishing emails.
 By looking at our findings, future study regarding the success of authority
 principle in phishing emails could be useful if we have data of phishing
 emails that have already claimed a victim.
 Thus, the goal for future research would be the success rate of the authority
 principle in phishing emails.
 In conjunction, a controlled environment to test persuasion awareness would
 be helpful to see whether it reduces phishing victimization through emails
 or not.
 Finally, as we understand that persuasion principles in phishing email
 have some influence in user’s decisions, it would be interesting if future
 research can build a simple game in terms of persuasion awareness to grab
 a user’s attention to make the right decision.
 For instance, the flowchart in
