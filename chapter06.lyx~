\begin_layout Section*
Decision making consideration based on Cialdini's principles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Part of our analysis, we tried to characterized phishing emails based on
 Cialdini’s principles titled “The science of persuasion”.
 The decision making in this phase is achieved based our perspective of
 Cialdini’s principles that we later will explain in this short description.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Reciprocation: The norm that obligates individuals to repay in kind what
 they have received.
 Return the favor.
 Adjustment to smaller request [1].
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Consistency: Public commitment.
 Where people become psychologically become vested in a decision they have
 made [2].
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Social proof: where people model the behavior of their peer group, role
 models, important others or because it is generally "fashionable" [2].
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Likeability: where people trust and comply with requests from others who
 they find attractive or are perceived as credible and having special expertise
 or abilities such as sports figures or actors they like [2].
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Authority: it can be used to engender fear, where people obey commands to
 avoid negative consequences such as losing a privilege or something of
 value, punishment, humiliation or condemnation [2].
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Scarcity: based on the principle of reactance, where people respond to perceived
 shortages by placing greater psychological value on perceived scarce items
 [2].
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Reciprocation
\emph default
: When a phisher sends an email containing a message that perceived as a
 request or obligation towards the recipient to “return the favor”.
 It might be normal for an individual to feel “obligated” to return the
 favor for things or information that he/she deemed to be valuable.
 For example in the phishing email context, when PayPal has detected there
 are suspicious activities on our account, we sometimes believe that PayPal
 has done a good job in detecting security risk on their system and we feel
 “obligated” to return the favor of that valuable information.
 Another example, if the sender gave the information that they have added
 “extra security” on their system so that we also feel obligated to grant
 their request.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Consistency
\emph default
: When a phishing email contains a message that perceived to request recipient’s
 “consistency” on a decision they have made.
 For example in the phishing email context, when a hotel agent asks us to
 review the payment details of our reservation that we have previously made,
 we might feel committed or agreed to review the payment details that has
 been given.
 Another example, if Facebook gave a link to change your password that you
 requested previously to change it.
 It might be not applicable to those who are not requesting password previously,
 but we believe it will impact to those who are committed to change the
 password previously.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Social proof
\emph default
: When a phishing email contains an affiliation of other people that they
 deemed to be “fashionable”.
 For example, when someone tells us that there are a hundreds of other people
 who use particular system, so we might want to agree to use it as well
 just because a lot of other people use it as well.
 Another example, when Facebook give information that someone wants to be
 our friend, and we knew who that someone is.
 We might tend to follow that request and click the link to accept the request.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Likeability
\emph default
: When a phishing email contains a message that attracts recipient to comply
 the sender’s request based the reference on something or someone that likeable
 for the recipient.
 Cialdini [1] identified that people usually “trust those they like”.
 For example, if someone is asking us to download and listen to a music
 that Michael Jackson made, we might be attracted to download and listen
 to it just because we happen to love Michael Jackson music.
 It is like someone is asking us to watch a concert and he/she said, “Coldplay
 will be there”, if we are devoted fan of Coldplay, we might find it very
 interesting.
 Another example, when a sender gives compliments to us or committed to
 help us to safeguard our account from the hackers, we tend to think that
 the sender cares about our safety, which is good for us, and consequently
 it might attract us to comply with the sender’s request.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Authority
\emph default
: When a phishing email contains logo or image or signature or anything
 that looks like legitimate institutions.
 It can be used to makes it look trustworthy so that the recipient might
 accept and obey the sender’s request.
 For example, when an email is presenting somehow authentic looking signature
 like “Copyright 2013 PayPal, Inc.
 All rights reserved” or PayPal logo.
 Cialdini [1] stated authoritative persuasion could be achieved by only
 presenting “aura of legitimacy”.
 Another example, when the content of the email stated that it is from “System
 Administrator” asking for password update.
 It would be not authoritative if only random people asking us to change
 our password.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Scarcity
\emph default
: When a phishing email contains a message that tells a recipient to react
 or respond to scarce/turns-into scarce items or things or privileges.
 For example in the phishing email context, if a sender tells us that he/she
 will suspend/deactivate/limit our account if not respond to his/her request,
 we might want to respond to their request because we are worried we will
 not able to access our account again or in other words our account become
 scarce or limited.
