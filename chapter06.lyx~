Discussion & Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the previous chapter, we have addressed the data and analysis of our
 study in considerable detail.
 Now in this chapter, we look at how our findings answer our research questions
 and whether the findings are consistent with the hypotheses we described
 in

.
 Lastly, we conclude our research including recommendations, limitations
 as well as future works.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before we conclude our main analysis, we would like to conclude of our experimen
tal exploration on phishing bad neighborhood and the differences between
 phishing vs original.
 Our data suggests that there are some possibilities of phishing bad neighborhoo
d (10% hacked, 35% higher possibilities, 55% less possibilities), there
 are much more legitimate domains that are exist.
 When we look at phishing vs original analysis, it suggests 87% of the total
 HTML codes are maintaining the appearance closer as the target while 12.5%
 are completely different with its target.
 Based on this, we can conclude while there are small possibilities of

\end_inset

 in term of phishing, phishers generally do not host their phish in one
 certain networks of internet infrastructure.
 The consequence is that it hinders the effort of security expert to detect
 phishing in a certain networks of internet infrastructures.
 We can also conclude that most of the phishes appear the same as its target
 considering to replicate a web page can be done with a little effort.
 However, fragments of suspicious codes can be spotted when the HTML source
 is closely examined.
 This can help an automated phishing detection in HTML source level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our research was mainly aimed to to characterize phishing email properties
 considering persuasive principles by finding the association within generic
 properties as well as the relationship between persuasive principles and
 these generic properties.
 We looked at what are the generic properties of phishing email and how
 relevant are the persuasive principles to the generic properties.
 The data was obtained from national security organization based in Netherlands
 that handles reports on fraud including phishing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An important aspect of our research was that persuasive techniques have
 variety of strengths in respect of influence depending on the individual
 person.
 Thus we have addressed the conception and rationale in considering persuasive
 principles on phishing emails.
 In addition, persuasion technique as a social engineering has been and
 remains successful in exploiting human factor vulnerability in order to
 influence people to have a positive response in favor of the person who
 requested it.
 Yet, it is almost absent from the computing literature perspective

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To answer the first research question
\shape italic
 RQ1
\shape default
, based on our findings, we can conclude in respect to the characteristics
 of reported phishing emails in the following points:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When an attachment(s) is included in a phishing email, it is likely to attach
 ZIP or HTML file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Requesting to click URL is the most prevalent method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Most of the phishes are using HTML code along with the presence of URL(s)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Financial sector is the most common target
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Most of the phishing emails use account related as a pretext to manipulate
 intended victims
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Authority principle is distributed throughout the sample
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Phishing email which has account related as a pretext, is likely to include
 URL(s)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Clear instructions to request an action from recipients
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
URL(s) in a phishing email is most likely to be obfuscated
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A government targeted phish is likely to have a document related reason
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Phishing email which has document related reason as a pretext, is likely
 to include an attachment(s)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our recommendation in term of phishing countermeasures, a recipient should
 scrutinize the email when zip or html attachment is included.
 A recipient should also be skeptical when an email is coming from a financial
 institution and is regarding account related reason.
 When URL(s) provided in the email, a recipient should take a closer look
 at the source whether the URL(s) is obfuscated or not.
 If a recipient has already clicked the URL, we can draw from the experimental
 exploration that most of the phishes are maintaining the appearance mimicking
 their targets.
 More importantly, a recipient should be thoughtful in making decision when
 an email portray fear or negative consequences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To answer the second research question 
\shape italic
RQ2
\shape default
, we look at the extent the persuasive principles that are used in phishing
 emails, we know that authoritative principle is distributed throughout
 the sample, thus it makes sense that we find 100% government targeted emails
 are having authority principle and 95.9% of non government targeted email
 are also having authority principle.
 Our data suggests that there is no significant association between government
 targeted email and authority principle.
 Similarly, administrator and non administrator targeted emails are both
 high in respect to authority principle.
 Moreover, our result on authority principle and image(s) presence in a
 phishing email suggests that there is no association between these two
 variables.
 This indicates that authority is indeed the most used principle and have
 higher chance to be the main technique of a phishing email.
 When we look at financial targeted sector and scarcity principle, we find
 that both financial and non financial targeted emails are less chance to
 have scarcity principle.
 Apart from our hypothesis related to financial sector and scarcity principle,
 if we look deeper, administrator targeted emails are likely to have scarcity
 principle.
 In contrary, non administrator targeted emails are less likely to have
 scarcity principle.
 When we look at account related phishing and scarcity, we find that there
 is a highly significant relationship between them.
 This means that if a phishing email involve in account related reason,
 the higher chance of scarcity principle as a persuasion technique.
 Our next finding on the relationship between e-commerce/retails targeted
 emails indicates that this sector contributes less number of likeability
 principle as both e-commerce/retails and non-ecommerce/retails targeted
 emails have high number of non-likeability principle.
 Similarly, our data suggests that there are no significant association
 between social media targeted emails and social proof principle.
 However, we find that there is a significant relationship between the use
 of HTML and likeability principle, this suggests that likeability phishing
 email tend to use HTML code to persuade unsuspecting victim.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another observation on authority and scarcity principle, it suggests that
 there is no significant association between them, as both authoritative
 and non-authoritative emails contribute less percentage on scarcity principle.
 We have also observed whether likeability and consistency have a relationship,
 our data suggests that there is a significant association between them.
 Our result signifies that the higher likeability, the lower chance to have
 consistency principle.

Based on our findings, although there are seven hypotheses in respect of
 persuasive principles are rejected, three of them are accepted.
 This concludes the extent of involvement of overall persuasive principles
 is low in term of the relationship to generic structural properties of
 a phishing email.
 On the other hand, we find that both administrator targeted phishing email
 and account related phishing email are likely to have scarcity principle.
 We also find a phishing email which use HTML code is likely to have likeability
 principle.

 summarizes the overview of verified hypotheses.
 These conclude scarcity principle has a high involvement in term of both
 administrator target and account related phish.
 In addition, while likeability principle has a significant association
 in term of HTML usage, however, likeability principle has a weak involvement
 in term of HTML usage in a phishing email.
 Thus, from our conclusions, we recommend a recipient to scrutinize when
 an email requires to respond to scarce or turn-into scarce items or things
 or privileges.
 We also recommend not to be negligent when an email is coming from others
 who they find attractive or are perceived as credible and having special
 expertise.

Overall, our research sheds light on the characteristics of phishing email
 considering persuasive principle as human factor in the real world analysis
 which has not been done yet.

\begin_layout Standard
However, our findings need to be assimilated in the backdrop of some limitations
 which arise due to the complex nature of our methodology and research environme
nt.
 It is important for us to explain these limitations so that the readers
 can understand the findings of our research in the proper context.
 The first limitation is that we only get the data from one organization.
 Our study is totally dependent on the information documented by this organizati
on, in which we do not know whether the sample data represents national-wide
 or represents a certain area or criterion.
 The second limitation is that, sometimes the email does not show the complete
 structures because the reporter forwarded a suspected phishing email as
 an attachment which removes essential element of it such as original attachment
(s) included in the original email.
 This causes our study to be dependent on the reporter that reports to this
 organization as well.
 The third limitation is language barrier.
 A few number of suspected English-based phishing emails forwarded by the
 reporter along an information in Dutch language.
 It might be useful to know to understand the information provided by the
 reporter.
 The fourth limitation is that, our data classification is done by one person.
 It means the coding of the data into associated variables could be inaccurate.
 While the data coding to the generic structural properties of phishing
 email could be justified, however, the data coding into the persuasive
 principles could be an issue in term of accuracy.
 For example, one person claimed an email is attractive while another person
 claimed it is not.
 This introduces the greatest limitation to our research because it significantl
y impact our results.
 The fifth limitation is being the time period of the reported phishing
 emails which are only reported in the period of august - december 2013.
 This impact of our randomness of cases in term of time period.

Despite these considerable limitations, our research provides an insight
 into the use of persuasive principles in phishing email characteristics.
 A recommendation as a follow-up study with a larger sample encompassing
 more security organization as a data source and extended time period of
 reported phishing emails would be extremely desirable in order to test
 our findings.
 We feel that any future research along this line will find our work to
 be a useful starting point.
 Furthermore, we also recommend to add resilient validation in data classificati
on in term of persuasive principles by involving several people to have
 an objective decision.
 Lastly, given what we did, we can see that persuasion principles in phishing
 email have some influence in user's decisions, therefore, it is interesting
 if the future research can build a simple game in term of persuasion awareness
 to grab user's attention in making the right decision.
