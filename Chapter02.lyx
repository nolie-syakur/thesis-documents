Background & Literature review
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to meet our goal, necessary knowledge on phishing in general is
 required.
 This chapter introduces general understanding of phishing, an exploration
 of its damage in term of money, the overview of its modus operandi, a brief
 explanation on types of phishing, an understanding of bad neighborhoods
 on phishing, general phishing countermeasures and human factor in phishing
 attacks.

\begin_layout Section
What is phishing?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the Internet has brought convenience to many people for exchanging
 information, it also provides opportunities to carry malicious behavior
 such as online fraud on massive scale with a little cost to the attackers.
 The attackers can manipulate the Internet users instead of computer system
 (hardware or software) that significantly increase the barriers of technologica
l crime impact.
 Such human centered attacks could be done by social engineering.
 According to Jakobsson, et al.
 phishing is a form of social engineering that aim

 to retrieve credential from online users by mimicking trustworthy and legitimat
e institutions

.
 Phishing has a similar basic principle as ‘fishing’ in the physical world.
 Instead of fish, online users are lured by authentic looking communication
 and hooked by authentic looking websites.
 Not only that, online users also may be lured by respond to a phishing
 email, either replying or clicking a hidden URL within its content.
 There are diverse definitions of phishing in our literature reviews, therefore,
 we would like to discuss about its universal definition in later section.
 However, one of phishing definitions according to Oxford dictionary:

.
 An individual or a group who uses this technique is called 
\emph on
Phisher(s
\emph default
).
 After successfully obtained a sensitive information from the victim, phishers
 use this information to access victim’s financial accounts or committing
 credit card frauds.
 However, to formalize the damage of phishing in term of money is a challenging
 task.
 We will briefly explore the cost of phishing attacks in the later section.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, the technique or modus operandi of phishing may vary, but the
 most common technique of phishing attacks done by using fraudulent emails
 and websites 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "james:2005"

\end_inset

.
 A fraudulent website is designed in such a way that it may be identical
 to its legitimate target.
 While it may be true, phishing website also could be completely different
 with its target as there is no level of identicalness.
 In the following subsections, we will introduce how phishing was originally
 came about and how current literatures formally define phishing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The History 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first time the term "phishing" was published by the 
\begin_inset Flex CT - acronym
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

AOL
\end_layout

\end_inset

 UseNet Newsgroup on January 2, 1996 and was started to expand in 2004 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "phishorg"

\end_inset

.
 Since then, we considered phishing development in cyberspace has been flourishi
ng by phishers to make profit.
 Total losses due to phishing in 2004 reached more than U.S.
 $ 2 billion, it was involving more than 15,000 sites that become victims
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "fellman:2004"

\end_inset

.
 We will try to discuss about direct and indirect cost at present days in
 the later section.
 Evidently, Jakobsson, et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006"

\end_inset

 mentioned that in the early years of 90’s (according to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "phishorg"

\end_inset

 it was around 1995) many hackers would create bogus AOL user accounts with
 automatically generated fraudulent credit card information.
 Their intention to give this fake credit card information was to simply
 pass the validity tests performed by AOL.
 By the time the tests were passed, AOL was thinking that these accounts
 were legitimate and resulted to activate them.
 Consequently, these hackers could freely access AOL resources until AOL
 tried to actually bill the credit card.
 AOL realized that these accounts were using invalid billing information,
 thus deactivated the account.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While creating false AOL user accounts with fake credit card information
 was not exactly phishing attacks, but AOL’s effort to counter against the
 attacks was leading to development of phishing.
 This countermeasure includes directly verifying the legitimacy of credit
 card information and the associated billing identity, forced hackers to
 pursue alternative way 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006"

\end_inset

.
 Hackers were masquerading as AOL’s employees asking to other users for
 credit card information through AOL instant messenger and email system
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "phishorg"

\end_inset

.
 Jakobsson et al.
 suggest that phishing attacks were originating from this incident 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006"

\end_inset

.
 Since such attack has not been done before, many of users have been victimized
 by then.
 Eventually, AOL enforced warning system to the most of its customers to
 be vigilant when it comes to sensitive information 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "phishorg"

\end_inset

.
 At the present day, phishing attacks might not only being motivated by
 financial gain but also political reason, and they have been emerging not
 only aim to AOL users, but also any online users.
 Consequently, large number of legitimate institutions such as PayPal and
 eBay are being spoofed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The universal definition 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before we begin to understand deeper about how and why phishing attack works,
 we will briefly explore common phishing definition.
 Currently, there is no consensus definition, since almost in every research
 papers, academic textbook or journals has its own definition of phishing
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006,james:2005,tally:2004,clayton:2005,parno:2006,jakobsson:2005,dhamija2006phishing"

\end_inset

.
 Phishing is also constantly evolving, so it might be very challenging to
 define its universal terminology.
 There is not so much study that specifically addresses the standard of
 phishing definition.
 However, one research conducted by Lastdrager 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "lastdrager:2014"

\end_inset

 addressed to achieve consensual definition of phishing.
 Before we comply with one consensual phishing terminology, we will take
 a look at various phishing definitions from other sources:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\begin_layout Quote

Phishing is a form of Internet scam in which the attackers try to trick

In phishing, an automated form of social engineering, criminals use the

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "parno:2006"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is noteworthy that the definition described by James, et al, Tally, et
 al, and Clayton, et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "james:2005,tally:2004,clayton:2005"

\end_inset

 specifies that the phishers only use email as a communication channel to
 trick potential victims.
 While it might be true because using email would greatly cost effective,
 but we believe that phishing is not only characterized by one particular
 technological mean, as phishers can also use any other electronic communication
 to trick potential victims (i.e private message on online social network).
 This definition is also similar to dictionary libraries 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "oxford,collins,merriam"

\end_inset

 that mention email as a medium communication between phishers and users.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We believe that standard definition of phishing should be applicable in
 most of phishing concept that are presently defined.
 Consequently, the high level of abstraction and is required to build common
 definition on phishing.
 We have convinced that the formal definition of phishing should not focus
 on the technology that is being used but rather on the technique how the
 deception is being conducted, the method of an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

act
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 if you will.
 Therefore, We follow the definition of phishing by Lastdrager 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "lastdrager:2014"

\end_inset

 which stated: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\shape italic
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Phishing is a scalable act of deception whereby impersonation is used to
 obtain information from a target
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to Lastdrager 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "lastdrager:2014"

\end_inset

, to achieve this universal definition, a systematic review of literature
 up to August 2013 was conducted along with manual peer review, which resulted
 in 113 distinct definitions to be analyzed.
 We thereby agree with Lastdrager 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "lastdrager:2014"

\end_inset

 that this definition addresses all the essential elements of phishing and
 we will adopt it as universally accepted terminology throughout our research.

\end_inset

The costs of phishing attacks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is a challenging task to find a real cost from phishing attacks in term
 of money or direct cost.
 This due to financial damage for bank is only known by banks and most instituti
ons do not share this information with the public.
 Evidently, Jakobsson et al.
 argue that phishing economy is consistent with black market economy and
 does not advertise its successes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006"

\end_inset

.
 On this section, a brief explanation of direct and indirect cost on phishing
 attack will be illustrated based on literature review
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to Jakobsson et al., direct cost is depicted by the value of money
 or goods that are directly stolen through phishing attack 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006"

\end_inset

.
 While indirect cost is the costs that do not represent the money nor goods
 that are actually stolen, but it is the costs has to be paid by the people
 who handle these attacks 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006"

\end_inset

 (i.e.
 time, money and resources spent to reset people password).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we mentioned earlier, the difficulty of assessing the damage on phishing
 attacks is caused by banks and institutions that keep this information
 themselves and the unwillingness of many users to share to acknowledge
 that they have been victimized by phishing attacks.
 This happens because of fear of humiliation, financial loses, or legal
 liability 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006"

\end_inset

.
 Evidently, studies estimate the damage ranging from $61 million 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "herley:2009"

\end_inset

 to $3 billion per year 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "mccall2007gartner"

\end_inset

 of direct losses to victims in the US only

LatexCommand citep
key "hong:2012"

\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "moura2009scalable"

\end_inset

.
 In addition, the Gartner Group claimed to estimate of $1.2 billion direct
 losses of phishing attack to US banks and credit card companies for the
 year 2004 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "litan2:2004"

\end_inset

.
 By the 2007, it escalated to more than $3 billion loss 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "mccall:2007"

\end_inset

.
 The estimation also performed by TRUSTe and Pontoon Institute that stated
 the cost of phishing attack was up to $500 millions losses in the US for
 the same year 
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
http://wow.theregister.co.uk/2004/09/29/phishing_survey/
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, the lack of information such as the detailed of documentation survey
 on how to find these numbers conducted by Gartner group or Pontoon makes
 these estimations are biased than is generally realized.
 It is interesting to investigate why their estimations are repeated without
 really analyzed when they appeared biased at best.
 One thing come up in our mind that they might have a hidden agenda to make
 societies think that the cost of phishing is high.
 Consequently, people would be obligated to implement anti phishing system
 or engage in phishing awareness in their company which require money.
 With this in mind, we would like to emphasize that our findings on the
 costs of phishing attacks are only estimations without scrutiny from academic
 researchers and it might be an exaggeration.
 Although even if the cost of phishing attack is zero, we believe that phishing
 is still a major problem in terms of trust among users and the misuse of
 email as a means of communication.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Apart from the cost of phishing attacks, we might ask how phishing attack
 is carried out? is there any stages involved? The next chapter we will
 review its modus operandi in term of phishing stages or phases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Modus operandi
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we mentioned earlier, Phishing attack is a subset of identity theft.
 The modus operandi might be carried out firstly by creating a fake website
 that spoofs legitimate website such as financial website, either identical
 or not identical as long as the phishers get responds from unsuspected
 victims.
 After that, the phishers will try to trick the potential victim to submit
 important information such as usernames, passwords, PINs, etc.
 through a fake website that they have created or through email reply from
 victims.
 With the information obtained, they will try to steal money from their
 victims if target institution is a bank.
 Phishers employ variety of techniques to trick potential victims to access
 their fraudulent website.
 One of the typical ways is by sending illicit email in a large scale claiming
 to be from legitimate institution.
 In the email content, they usually imitate an official-looking logo, using
 good business language style and often also forge the email headers to
 make it look like originating from legitimate institution.
 For example, the content of the email is to inform the user that the bank
 is changing its IT infrastructure, and request urgently that the customer
 should update their data with the consequence of loosing their money if
 the action does not take place.
 When the user click the link that was on the email message, they will be
 redirected to a fraudulent website, which will prompt the victim to fill
 in the details of their information.
 While there are various techniques of phishing attack, we will address
 the common phases of phishing that we analyzed by literature survey by
 several studies and also we will address our own phishing phases.
 These phases are compiled in

, on the first process is called

Planning

, a phisher usually would do some reconnaissance on how would the attack
 is executed and what information would be obtained from the victim.
 On the second process, the phisher would think about the design of the
 email.
 This email is desired by the phisher to look as legit as possible to potential
 victim.
 For this purpose, target institutions logo, trademark, symbol, etc.
 are used to make the content look official to the victim.
 The author called this process as

 From the figure, we can spot a fake email by investigating the sender email
 address or the URL provided in the body, whether it redirects to the official
 ING website or not.
 On the third process, the phisher 
\shape italic
fabricates
\shape default
 a story to make potential victim think that email is important.
 To achieve users attention, phisher might build up a story about system
 upgrade, account hijacked or security enhancement so that the victim would
 feel obliged to be informed.
 Evidently, this technique corresponds with Cialdini 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 that suggests there are six principles to persuade people to comply with
 a request.
 On the fourth process, a phisher usually include 
\shape italic
threatening tone

 or explain the urgency and consequences if the potential victim chooses
 not to take action desired by the phisher (for example; account removal,
 account blocked, etc.).
 Consequently, users may fear of their account being deleted.
 The last process involved with fraudulent website that has been created
 by the phisher.
 Users may falsely believe to the message given in the email and may click
 a

 Subsequently, the URL would redirect users to a

 Furthermore, the website might be created to be as similar as possible
 to the target institution’s website, so that potential victim may still
 believe that it is authentic.

Considering that phishing attack is a process, Wetzel

 suggested a taxonomy to make sense of the complex nature of the problem
 by mapping out a common attacks lifecycle, and a possible set of activities
 attackers engage in within each phase.
 The taxonomy is illustrated in 
\begin_inset Flex CT - auto cross-reference

 We speculated that Wetzel's taxonomy is not analogous with Frauenstein's
 main phishing processes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The difference is that Frauenstein et al.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\shape italic
Planning
\shape default
: Preparation carried out by the phisher before continue to the next phase.
 Example activities include identifying targets and victims, determine the
 method of the attack, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\shape italic
Setup
\shape default
: After the target, victim and the method are known, the phisher would craft
 a platform where the victim's information could be transmitted and stored,
 for example: fraudulent website/email.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\shape italic
Attack
\shape default
: Phisher distributes their fraudulent platform so that it can be delivered
 to the potential victims with fabricated stories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\shape italic
Collection
\shape default
: Phisher collects valuable information via response from the victims
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\shape italic
Fraud
\shape default
: Phisher abuses victim's information by impersonates the identity of the
 victim to the target.
 For example, A has gained B's personal information to access C so that
 A can pose as B to access C.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\shape italic
Post-attack
\shape default
: After the phisher gained profit from the attack and abuse phases, a phisher
 would not want to be noticed or detected by authority.
 Thus, phisher might need to destroy evidence of the activities that he/she
 previously were executed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As shown in

 Tally, et al.
 suggest that there are several phases involved in phishing attack based
 on the attacker's point of view 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "tally:2004"

\end_inset

.
 The first phase, it represents the planning, as we understand the attacker
 collects the email address of unsuspecting victims.
 The second phase, considering that it is related to creating a fake email
 that appears legitimate, this phase can be viewed as design phase.
 On the third phase, we consider this as delivery and attack phases as it
 involves the attacker sends the fake email to the unintended victims and
 hide the true source.
 The fourth phase represents attack phase as it involves with the recipient
 complies with the attacker's request(s).
 Lastly the fifth phase, it represents the fraud phase, as it related to
 haversting and exploiting victim's resources by the attacker.
 Additionally, the phases described by Tally, et al.

Based on our analysis by looking at the pattern of other phases from various
 sources, there is a major similarity between them.
 Therefore, we would like to define and design our own phase that are integrated
 with three key components suggested by Jakobsson, et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 These key components are include

 As we designed in

It is important to know that in the phase 3, there are different scenarios

 may comply to call by phone.
 However, in

We have reviewed various phases in phishing attack and from the review,
 we have constructed our own phases.
 In the next section, a brief introduction in respect to the types of phishing
 will be described.
 We believe that the general understanding of phishing types will help our
 main analysis to characterize phishing email properties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Types of phishing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In January 2014, 8300 patients data are being compromised in medical company
 in the US 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "adam:2014"

\end_inset

.
 The data includes names, addresses, date of birth and phone numbers were
 being stolen.
 Other than demographic information, clinical information associated with
 this data was also stolen, including social security numbers.
 In the April 2014, phishers have successfully stolen US$163,000 from US
 public school based on Michigan 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ashley:2014"

\end_inset

.
 It has been said that the email prompted to transfer money is coming from
 the finance director of the school.
 In March 2014, Symantec has discovered phishing attack aimed at Google
 drive users 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "teri:2014"

\end_inset

.
 The attack was carried firstly with incoming email asking for opening document
 hosted at Google docs.
 Users that have clicked on the link are taken to fraudulent Google login
 page prompted Google users credentials.
 Interestingly, the URL seems very convincing because it hosted on Google
 secure servers.
 We hypothesized that even more phishing incidents on financial area as
 well, but sometimes the news is kept hidden due to creditability reason.
 With this in mind, we believe fake websites might be hosted in the network
 which has more phishing domain than other networks.
 Subsequently, in the next section, we will discuss bad neighborhoods on
 phishing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One may ask, what type of phishing are these? What are the general types
 of phishing relevant to our research? Evidently, based on the cost of phishing
 attacks in 
\begin_inset Flex CT - auto cross-reference
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

sec:cost-of-phishing
\end_layout

\end_inset

, the threat of phishing attacks is still alarming and might be evolving
 in the future with more sophisticated technique of attacks.
 For this reason, it might be useful to provide a brief insight on popular
 variants of phishing that currently exist.
 We will briefly explain the types of phishing which are the most relevant
 to our research based on Jakobsson, et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006"

\end_inset

.
 These types of phishing is strongly related to the phishing definition
 that we used, considering phishing is based on the act of deception by
 the phishers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Phishing based on visual similarities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since all phishing is based on deception and social engineering, there is
 a phishing scenario based on visual similarities.
 Typical scenario of phishing based on visual similarities is to send a
 large amount of illicit emails containing call to action asking recipients
 to click embedded links 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006"

\end_inset

.
 These variations include cousin domain attack.
 For example, legitimate PayPal website addressed as wow.paypal.com, this
 cousin domain attacks confuse potential victims to believe that wow.paypal-secur
ity.com is a subdivision of the legitimate website due to identical looking
 addresses.
 Similarly, homograph attacks create a confusion using similar characters
 to its addresses.
 For example, wow.paypal.com and wow.paypa1.com, both addresses look the same
 but on the second link, it uses “1” instead of “l”.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, phishers may embed a login page directly to the email content.
 This suggests the elimination of the need of end-users to click on a link
 and phishers do not have to manage an active fraudulent website.
 IP addresses are often used instead of human readable hostname to redirect
 potential victim to phishing website and JavaScript is used to take over
 address bar of a browser to make potential victims believe that they are
 communicating with the legitimate institution.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another type of deceptive phishing scheme is rock-phish attacks.
 They held responsible for half a number of reported incidents worldwide
 in 2005 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "moore:2007"

\end_inset

.
 These attacks evade email filters by utilizes random text and GIF images
 which contain the actual message.
 Rock phish attacks also utilize a toolkit that capable to manage several
 fraudulent websites in a single domain.
 Sometimes, deceptive phishing schemes lead to installation of malware when
 users visit fraudulent website and we will describe malware based phishing
 scheme in the next section.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Malware-based phishing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generally, malware based phishing refers to any type of phishing which involves
 installing malicious piece of software onto users' personal computer 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006"

\end_inset

.
 Subsequently, this malware is used to gather confidential information from
 victims instead of spoofing legitimate websites.
 This type of phishing incorporates malwares such as keyloggers/screenloggers,
 web Trojans and hosts file poisoning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the next section, we will study on the general phishing countermeasures
 in term of phishing detection and prevention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Current countermeasures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are various types of phishing countermeasures that implemented in
 different levels.
 Purkait has conducted an extensive research in reviewing these countermeasures
 which are available up until 2012 and their effectiveness 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "purkait"

\end_inset

.
 He suggests that there is a classification of phishing countermeasures
 in separate groups and according to Purkait 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "purkait"

\end_inset

, these groups are listed as follow:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, Parmar, et al.
 suggests that phishing detection can be classified into two types; user
 training approach and software classification approach 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

.
 He illustrated a diagram and a table that summarizes phishing detection
 as countermeasures in a broad view 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 They also argued the advantages and disadvantages of each category 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

.
 However, as our research mainly focuses in synthesizing phishing email
 with cialdini's six principles of persuasion 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "cialdini:2001"

\end_inset

, we will briefly discuss the most relevant phishing countermeasures such
 as restriction list group (i.e.
 Phishtank), machine learning approach (web-based phishing), properties
 or features in a phishing email, and anti phishing training group (i.e PhishGuru
).
 In the last section of this chapter, we will explore the human factor in
 phishing attacks, how phishing email is engineered to gain recipient's
 trust in order to get a response from the unsuspecting victims.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Phishing detection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this subsection, we will conduct a literature review which related to
 phishtank as restriction list and machine learning approach to detect spoofed
 website as phishing detection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Phishtank
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the common approaches to detect phishing attacks is the implementation
 of restriction list.
 As the name suggest, it prevents users to visit fraudulent websites.
 One of the efforts to achieve restriction list, is to derive phishing URLs
 from Phishtank.
 Phishtank is a blacklisting company specifically for phishing URLs and
 it is a free community web based where users can report, verify and track
 phishing URLs 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "phishtank"

\end_inset

.
 Phishtank stores phishing URLs in its database and is widely available
 for use by other companies for creating restriction list.
 Some of the big companies that are using Phishtank’s data includes; Yahoo
 Mail, McAfee, APWG, Web Of Trust, Kaspersky, Opera and Avira.
 In this section, we will discuss how the current literatures have to do
 with phish data provided by Phishtank.
 The first step to achieve the list of relevant literatures regarding phishtank
 is by keyword search in Scopus online library.
 By putting 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Phishtank
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as a keyword search, it results in 12 literatures.
 The next step, we read the all the abstracts and conclusions of the resulting
 keyword search and we decided 11 literatures that are relevant to our research.

 For example, in the case of individual wealth in a country, 80% of the
 all wealth is controlled by 20% of population in a country.
 It makes sense that in Phishtank’s verification system, a single highly
 active user’s action can greatly impact the system’s overall accuracy.

 Moreover, there are some ways to disrupt Phishtank verification system;
 submitting invalid reports accusing legitimate website, voting legitimate
 website as phish, and voting illegitimate website as not phish.
 While all the scenarios described are for the phishers' benefit, the last
 scenario is more direct and the first two actions rather subtle intention
 to undermine Phishtank credibility.

To put it briefly, the lesson of crowd sourced anti-phishing technology
 such as Phishtank is that the distribution of user participation matters.
 It means that if a few high value participants do something wrong, it can
 greatly impact overall system

 Also, there is a high probability that bad users could also extensively

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Machine learning approach in detecting spoofed website
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fundamental of phishing detection system would be to distinguish between
 phishing websites and the legitimate ones.
 As we previously discussed, the aim of phishing attack is to gather confidentia
l information from potential victims.
 To do this, phishers often prompt for this information through fraudulent
 websites and masquerade as legitimate institutions.
 It does not make sense if phishers created them in a way very distinctive
 with its target.
 It may raise suspicions with result of unsuccessful attack.
 To put it another way, while it might be true, we speculated that most
 of the phishing websites are mostly identical with its legitimate websites
 as target to reduce suspiciousness from potential victim.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast of one of blacklisting technique we saw in Phishtank that heavily
 depend on human verification, researchers make use of machine learning
 based technique to automatically distinguish between phishing and legitimate
 either websites or email.
 Basically, machine-learning system is a platform that can learn from previous
 data and predict future data with its classification, in this case, phishing
 and legitimate.
 In order for this machine to learn from data, there should be some kind
 of inputs to classify the data, it is called features or characteristics.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, there are also several learning algorithms to classify the
 data, such as, logistic regression, random forest, neural networks and
 support vector machine.
 However, as this particular topic is out of scope of our research, we will
 not discuss about the learning algorithm that is currently implemented.
 We will only introduce three features that are used in machine learning
 based detection.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are vast amount of features that can be used in machine learning to
 detect phishing attack.
 Literatures are selected by keyword search such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

phishing + detection + machine learning
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 We analyze three features: lexical feature, host-based feature and site
 popularity feature.
 Each of these features will be introduced briefly as follows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Lexical features
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lexical features (URL based features) are based on the analysis of URL structure
 without any external information.
 Ma, et al.
 suggest that the structure URL of phishing may “look” different to experts
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ma:2009"

\end_inset

.
 These features include how many dots exist, the length, how deep the path
 traversal do the URL has or if there any sensitive words present in a URL.
 For example the URLs https://wow.paypal.com and http://wow.paypal.com.example.com/
 or http://login.example.com/ wow.paypal.com/, we can see that the domain paypal.com
 positioned differently, with the first one being the benign URL.
 Le, et al suggests we can extract the features related to the full URL,
 domain name, directory, file name and argument 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "le:2011"

\end_inset

.
 For example we want to extract features related to the full URL; we can
 define the length of the URL, the number of dots in the URL, and whether
 the blacklisted word presents in the URL.
 The blacklisted words consist of sensitive words such as confirm, account,
 login or webscr.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lexical features analysis may have performance advantage and reduces overhead
 in term of processing and latency, since it only tells the machine to learn
 URL structure.
 90% accuracy is achieved when utilizing lexical features combined with
 external features such as WHOIS data 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "le:2011"

\end_inset

.
 Egan, et al.
 conducted an evaluation of lightweight classification that includes lexical
 features and host based features in its model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "egan:2011"

\end_inset

.
 The study found that the classification based on these features resulted
 in extremely high accuracy and low overhead.

\end_inset

 lists the existing lexical features that are currently implemented by two
 different studies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "xiang:2011,liu"

\end_inset

.
 However, Xiang, et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "xiang:2011"

\end_inset

 pointed out that URLs structure could be manipulated with little cost,
 causing the features to fail.
 For example, attackers could simply remove embedded domain and sensitive
 words to make their phishing URLs look legitimate.
 Embedded domain feature examines whether a domain or a hostname is present
 in the path segment 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "xiang:2011"

\end_inset

, for example, http://wow.example.net/pathto/wow.paypal.com.
 Suspicious URL feature examine whether the URL has 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

@
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

-
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, the present of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

@
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is examined in a URL because when the symbol 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

@
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is used, the string to the left will be discarded.
 Furthermore, according to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "xiang:2011"

\end_inset

, not many legitimate websites use 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

-
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in their URLs.
 There are also plenty of legitimate domains presented only with IP address
 and contains more dots.
 Nevertheless, lexical analysis would be suitable features to use for first
 phase analysis in a large data

Each of these features does matter for phishing detection.
 However, as our main objective is synthesizing cialdini's principle with
 phishing emails, we will not describe each of these features in detail.
 It is noteworthy that some of the features are subset of another feature,
 for instance, autonomous system number (ASN), IP country and number of
 registration information are derived from WHOIS information.
 Nevertheless, we will only explain few of them that we assume the most
 crucial.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
WHOIS information: Since phishing websites and hacked domains are often
 created at relatively young age, this information could provide the registratio
n date, update date and expiration date.
 Domain ownership would also be included; therefore, a set of malicious
 websites with the same individual could be identified.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
IP address information: Justin Ma, et al.
 used this information for identify whether or not an IP address is in blacklist
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ma2:2009,ma:2009"

\end_inset

.
 Besides the corresponding IP address, it provides records like nameservers
 and mail exchange servers.
 This allows the classifier to be able to flag other IP addresses within
 the same IP prefix and ASN.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Domain name properties: these include time to live (TTL) of DNS associated
 with a hostname.
 PTR record (reverse DNS lookup) of a domain could also be derived whether
 it is valid or not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Site popularity features
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Site popularity could be an indicator whether a website is phishy or not.
 It makes sense if a phishing website has much less traffic or popularity
 than a legitimate website.

 Phishers may design a fake email to resemble the reputable company to gain
 users trust.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Link in the text is different from the destination.
 A link(s) contained in the email message usually appears different than
 the actual link destination.
 This portrays hidden URL and this method used to trick users to believe
 that the email is legitimate.

 Sometimes phishers may hide the link in the message by presenting it as
 IP address instead of URL.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

 As phishing emails are distributed by large number of recipients, the email
 often is not personalized, unlike the legitimate email that address its
 recipient by personalized information such as the last four digits of account

 Therefore, human factors take a big part on the phishing taxonomy, especially

, it has been shown that information security awareness is important and
 it has been critical success factors to mitigate security vulnerabilities
 that attack user’s trust.
 One approach to hopefully prevent phishing attack was by implementing anti
 phishing warning/indicator.
 Dhamija, et al suggest that users often ignore security indicators thus
 makes them ineffective 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Even if users notice the security indicators, they often do not understand
 what they represent.

Moreover, the inconsistency of positioning on different browsers makes them
 much difficult to identify phishing 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Evidently, Schechter, et al.
 pointed out that 53% of their study participants were still attempting
 to provide their confidential information, even after their task was interrupte

 Therefore, these suggest that an effective phishing education must be added
 as a complementary strategy to complete technical anti-phishing measure
 as a strong remedy to detect phishing websites or emails.

 They also find that users who trained twice were less likely to give informatio
