\chapter{Background \& Literature review}

In order to meet our research goal, some necessary knowledge on phishing
in general is required. This chapter introduces a general understanding
of phishing, an exploration of its damage in financial terms, the
overview of its modus operandi, a brief explanation of types of phishing,
general phishing countermeasures, and human factor in phishing attacks.


\section{What is phishing?}

While the Internet has brought convenience to many people for exchanging
information, it also provides opportunities for malicious behavior
such as online fraud on a massive scale with little cost to the attackers.
The attackers can manipulate the Internet users instead of the computer
systems (hardware or software) that significantly increase the barriers
of technological crime impact. Such human-centered attacks could be
done by social engineering. According to Jakobsson et al., phishing
is a form of social engineering that aims to gain trust from online
users by mimicking trustworthy and legitimate institutions \citep{jakobsson:2006}.
Phishing has a similar basic principle to \textquoteleft fishing\textquoteright{}
in the physical world. Instead of fish, online users are lured by
authentic-looking communication and hooked by authentic-looking websites.
Not only that, online users also may be lured by responding to a phishing
email, either replying to or clicking on a hidden URL within its content.
There are diverse definitions of phishing in our literature reviews.
Therefore, we would like to discuss about its universal definition
in a later section. However, one of the definitions of phishing, according
to the Oxford Dictionary, is as follows:
\begin{quote}
``A fraudulent practice of sending emails purporting to be from reputable
companies in order to induce individuals to reveal personal information,
such as passwords and credit card numbers, online'' \citep{oxford}. 
\end{quote}
\begin{onehalfspace}
Several studies suggest that phishing is a form of online criminal
activity by using social engineering techniques \citep{jakobsson:2006}\citep{workman:2008}\citep{jagatic2007social}\citep{chandrasekaran:2006}.
An individual or a group who uses this technique is called \emph{Phisher(s}).
After successfully obtaining sensitive information from the victim,
phishers use this information to access victim\textquoteright s financial
accounts or to commit credit card fraud. However, to formalize the
damage of phishing in term of money is a challenging task. We will
briefly explore the cost of phishing attacks in a later section.
\end{onehalfspace}

The techniques or modus operandi of phishing may vary, but the most
common is using fraudulent emails and websites \citep{james:2005}.
A fraudulent website is designed in such a way that it may be identical
to its legitimate target. However, a phishing website could also be
completely different to its target as there is no level of identicalness.
In the following subsections, we introduce how phishing was originally
came about and how current literatures formally define phishing.


\subsection{The History }

The term \textquotedbl{}phishing\textquotedbl{} was first published
by the \ac{AOL} UseNet Newsgroup on January 2, 1996 and its use started
to expand in 2004 \citep{phishorg}. Since 1996, phishing has flourished.
In 2004, phishing was recognized as fully industrialized in terms
of economy of crime: On the black market off-the-shelf components
for ready-made phishing attacks were for sale \citep{abad2005economy}.
Jakobsson et al. \citep{jakobsson:2006} mentioned that in the early
years of the '90s (according to \citep{phishorg} it was around 1995)
many hackers would create bogus AOL user accounts with automatically
generated fraudulent credit card information. Their intention to give
this fake credit card information was to simply pass the validity
tests performed by AOL. By the time the tests were passed, AOL thought
that these accounts were legitimate and thus activated them. Consequently,
these hackers could freely access AOL resources until AOL tried to
actually bill the credit card. AOL realized that these accounts were
using invalid billing information and therefore deactivated the accounts.

While creating false AOL user accounts with fake credit card information
was not phishing, AOL's effort to counter these attacks led to the
development of phishing. AOL's countermeasure including directly verifying
the legitimacy of credit card information and the associated billing
identity, forced hackers to pursue alternative ways \citep{jakobsson:2006}.
Hackers masqueraded as AOL employees, asking other users for credit
card information through AOL's instant messenger and email system
\citep{phishorg}. Jakobsson et al. suggest that phishing attacks
originated from this incident \citep{jakobsson:2006}. Since such
attack had not been done before, many users fell victim to then. Eventually,
AOL enforced warning systems to most of its customers to be vigilant
when it comes to sensitive information \citep{phishorg}. To the present
day, phishing attacks might not only be motivated by financial gain
but also political reasons, and they emerged not only with AOL users,
but also any online users. Consequently, large number of legitimate
institutions such as PayPal and eBay are being spoofed.


\subsection{The universal definition }

Before we begin to understand deeper about how and why phishing attack
works, we briefly explore the common definition of phishing. Currently,
there is no consensus definition, since almost every research paper,
academic textbook or journal has its own definition of phishing \citep{jakobsson:2006,james:2005,tally:2004,clayton:2005,parno:2006,jakobsson:2005,dhamija2006phishing}.
Phishing is also constantly evolving, so it might be very challenging
to define its universal terminology. There are not so many studies
that specifically address the standard of phishing definition. An
exception is a piece of research conducted by Lastdrager \citep{lastdrager:2014},
which addressed a consensual definition of phishing. Before we decide
upon one consensual phishing terminology, we will take a look at various
phishing definitions from other sources:
\begin{quote}
``Phishing is the act of sending a forged e-mail (using a bulk mailer)
to a recipient, falsely mimicking a legitimate establishment in an
attempt to scam the recipient into divulging private information such
as credit card numbers or bank account passwords'' \citep{james:2005}

``Phishing is a form of Internet scam in which the attackers try
to trick consumers into divulging sensitive personal information.
The techniques usually involve fraudulent e-mail and websites that
impersonate both legitimate e-mail and websites'' \citep{tally:2004}

``Phishing is an attack in which victims are lured by official looking
email to a fraudulent website that appears to be that of a legitimate
service provider'' \citep{clayton:2005}

``In phishing, an automated form of social engineering, criminals
use the internet to fraudulently extract sensitive information from
business and individuals, often by impersonating legitimate websites''
\citep{parno:2006}
\end{quote}
It is noteworthy that the definitions described by James et al., Tally
et al., and Clayton et al. \citep{james:2005,tally:2004,clayton:2005}
specify that the phishers only use email as a communication channel
to trick potential victims. While it might be true because using email
is greatly cost effective, we believe that phishing is not only characterized
by one particular technological mean, as phishers can also use any
other electronic communication to trick potential victims, such as
private messages on online social networks. This definition is also
similar to dictionary libraries \citep{oxford,collins,merriam} that
mention email as a medium communication between phishers and users.

We believe that the standard definition of phishing should be applicable
to most phishing concepts that are presently defined. Consequently,
a high level of abstraction is required to build a common definition
of phishing. We are convinced that the formal definition of phishing
should not focus on the technology that is being used but rather on
the techniques of how the deception is being conducted, the method
of an \textquotedblleft act\textquotedblright{} if you will. Therefore,
we follow the definition of phishing by Lastdrager \citep{lastdrager:2014}
which states that:
\begin{quote}
\textit{``Phishing is a scalable act of deception whereby impersonation
is used to obtain information from a target''}
\end{quote}
Lastdrager \citep{lastdrager:2014} states that to achieve this universal
definition, a systematic review of literature up to August 2013 was
conducted along with a manual peer review, which resulted in 113 distinct
definitions to be analyzed. We thereby agree with Lastdrager \citep{lastdrager:2014}
that this definition addresses all the essential elements of phishing
and we will adopt it as the universally accepted definition throughout
our research.


\section{\label{sec:cost-of-phishing}The costs of phishing attacks}

It is a challenging task to find the real costs from phishing attacks
in terms of money or direct costs. This is because the financial damage
on banks is only known by the banks themselves and most institutions
do not share this information with the public. Jakobsson et al. argue
that the phishing economy is consistent with black market economy
and does not advertise its successes \citep{jakobsson:2006}. In this
section, a brief explanation of direct and indirect costs of phishing
attacks will be illustrated based on a literature review.

According to Jakobsson et al., direct costs are depicted by the value
of money or goods that are directly stolen through phishing attacks
\citep{jakobsson:2006}. Indirect costs are the costs that do not
represent the money or goods that are actually stolen, but the costs
which have to be paid by the people who handle these attacks \citep{jakobsson:2006},
i.e. time, money and resources spent to reset people's passwords.

As we mentioned earlier, it is difficult to assess the damage caused
by phishing attacks on banks and institutions as they keep this information
to themselves. Furthermore, many users are unwilling to acknowledge
that they have fallen prey to phishing attacks. This happens because
of fear of humiliation, financial loses, or legal liability \citep{jakobsson:2006}.
Studies estimate the damage of direct losses to victims in the US
only \citep{hong:2012}\citep{moura2009scalable} to range from \$61
million \citep{herley:2009} to \$3 billion per year \citep{mccall2007gartner}.
The Gartner Group estimated \$1.2 billion direct losses from phishing
attacks on US banks and credit card companies for the year 2004 \citep{litan2004phishing}.
By 2007, losses had escalated to more than \$3 billion \citep{mccall2007gartner}.
The estimation performed by TRUSTe and Ponemon Institute stated that
the cost of phishing attacks was up to \$500 million losses in the
US for the same year %
\footnote{http://wow.theregister.co.uk/2004/09/29/phishing\_survey/%
}.

The lack of information such as a detailed documentation survey on
how these numbers were found by Gartner group or Ponemon makes estimations
more biased than is generally realized. It is interesting to investigate
why their estimates are quoted without really analyzing their bias.
One thing that comes to mind is that they might have a hidden agenda
to make societies think that the cost of phishing is high. Consequently,
people would be obliged to implement anti-phishing systems or engage
in phishing awareness in their company, which requires money. With
this in mind, we would like to emphasize that our findings on the
costs of phishing attacks are only estimates without scrutiny from
academic researchers, and they might be an exaggeration. Having said
that, even if the cost of phishing attacks is zero, we believe that
phishing is still a major problem in terms of trust among users and
the misuse of email as a means of communication.

We now consider how phishing attacks are carried out, and if there
are distinct stages involved in the attacks? In the next section we
review phishing's modus operandi in term of phishing stages or phases.


\section{Modus operandi}

As we mentioned earlier, a phishing attack is a subset of identity
theft. One modus operandi is first to create a fake website that spoofs
legitimate website such as financial websites. These websites can
be either identical or not identical to real websites; the aim is
just to get a response from unsuspecting victims. After that, the
phishers will try to trick the potential victim into submitting important
information such as usernames, passwords and PINs through a fake website
that they have created or through email reply from victims. With the
information obtained, they will try to steal money from their victims,
if the target institution is a bank. 

Phishers employ a variety of techniques to trick potential victims
to access their fraudulent website. One of the typical ways is by
sending illicit emails on a large scale claiming to be from a legitimate
institution. In the email content, they usually imitate an official-looking
logo, using good business language style and often also forge the
email headers to make it look like originating from legitimate institution.
For example, the content of the email is to inform the user that the
bank is changing its IT infrastructure, and request urgently that
the customer should update their data with the consequence of loosing
their money if the action does not take place. While there are various
techniques of phishing attack, we address the common phases of phishing
that we analyzed in a literature survey of several studies and we
also address our own phishing phases. These phases are compiled in
\autoref{tab:compilation-phases}.

\par\end{flushleft}

Based on the example scenario explained earlier, phishing attacks
may consist of several phases. J. Hong \citep{hong:2012} argued that
there are three major phases, while Frauenstein et al. \citep{frauenstein:2013}
suggested that five main processes are used to perform phishing attacks
based on the perspective of the attacker.

\begin{figure}
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{\string"gfx/phishing processes\string".png}
\par\end{centering}

\protect\caption{\label{fig:frauenstein}Phishing processes based on Frauenstein\citep{frauenstein:2013}}
\end{figure}


As we illustrated in \autoref{fig:frauenstein}, the first process
is called \textit{Planning}. In this process a phisher would usually
do some reconnaissance on how would the attack is executed and what
information would be obtained from the victim. 

In the second process, the phisher would think about the design of
the email. This email is desired by the phisher to look as legitimate
as possible to potential victim. For this purpose, target institutions'
logos, trademarks, symbols, etc. are used to make the content look
official to the victim. The author called this process as \textit{Email
Design}. \autoref{fig:ing} illustrates the example design of a fake
email that impersonates ING bank and can trick unsuspecting victims%
\footnote{http://wow.martijn-onderwater.nl/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/ing-phishing.jpg%
}. From the figure, we can spot a fake email by investigating the real
sender email address by looking at the email header or the URL provided
in the body, seeing whether it redirects to the official ING website
or not. 

In the third process, the phisher \textit{fabricates} a story to make
potential victims think that email is important. To achieve user attention,
a phisher might build up a story about system upgrade, account hijacking
or security enhancement so that the victim would feel obliged to be
informed. Evidently, this technique corresponds with Cialdini \citep{cialdini:2001},
who suggests there are six principles to persuade people to comply
with a request. 

In the fourth process, a phisher usually includes a \textit{threatening
tone} or explain the urgency and consequences if the potential victim
chooses not to take action desired by the phisher (e.g. account removal,
account blocked). Consequently, users may fear for their account being
deleted. 

The last process involves a fraudulent website that has been created
by the phisher. Users may falsely believe the message given in the
email and may click on a \ac{URL} that is embedded in the email.
Subsequently, the URL redirects users to a \textit{spoofed website}
which may request users' sensitive information. Furthermore, the website
might be created to be as similar as possible to the target institution's
website, so that potential victim may still believe that it is authentic.
We will explain more about Cialdini's six basic tendencies of human
behavior in generating positive response to persuasion \citep{cialdini:2001}
in a later section.

\begin{figure}
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{gfx/ing-phishing}
\par\end{centering}

\protect\caption{\label{fig:ing}Example of a phishing email impersonating ING bank}
\end{figure}


Considering that phishing attack is a process, Wetzel \citep{wetzel:2005}
suggested a taxonomy to make sense of the complex nature of the problem
by mapping out a common attacks lifecycle, and a possible set of activities
attackers engage in within each phase. The taxonomy is illustrated
in \autoref{fig:wetzel}. We speculate that Wetzel's taxonomy is not
analogous with Frauenstein's main phishing processes \citep{frauenstein:2013}.
The difference is that Frauenstein et al. only focused on the design
of the attack while Wetzel has added several phases like \textit{Collection},
\textit{Fraud} and \textit{Post-attack}. Therefore, Wetzel's taxonomy
is more holistic in term of phishing.

\begin{figure}
\centering{}\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{gfx/wetzel}\protect\caption{\label{fig:wetzel}Phishing attack taxonomy and lifecycle\citep{wetzel:2005}}
\end{figure}


As we listed Wetzel's taxonomy in \autoref{tab:compilation-phases},
we explain more of the taxonomy as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{Planning}: Preparation carried out by the phisher before continuing
to the next phase. Example activities include identifying targets
and victims and determining the method of the attack.
\item \textit{Setup}: After the target, victim and the method are known,
the phisher crafts a platform where the victim's information could
be transmitted and stored, for example a fraudulent web- site/email.
\item \textit{Attack}: Phisher distributes their fraudulent platform so
that it can be delivered to the potential victims with fabricated
stories.
\item \textit{Collection}: Phisher collects valuable information via response
from the victims.
\item \textit{Fraud}: Phisher abuses victim's information by impersonating
the identity of the victim to the target. For example, A has gained
B\textquoteright s personal information to access C so that A can
pose as B to access C.
\item \textit{Post-attack}: After the phisher gained profit from the attack
and abuse phases, they would not want to be noticed or detected by
authority. Thus, the phisher might need to destroy evidence of the
activities that he/she had undertaken.
\end{enumerate}
As shown in \autoref{tab:compilation-phases}, Tally et al. suggest
that there are several phases involved in a phishing attack based
on the attacker's point of view \citep{tally:2004}. The first phase
represents the planning, where the attacker collects the email address
of unsuspecting victims. The second phase, considering that it is
related to creating a fake email that appears legitimate, can be viewed
as design phase. We consider the third phase as the delivery and attack
phases as it involves the attacker sending a fake email to the unintended
victims and hiding the true source. The fourth phase represents attack
phase as it involves with the recipient complying with the attacker\textquoteright s
request(s). Lastly, the fifth phase represents the fraud phase, as
it related to the attacker harvesting and exploiting the victim's
resources. Additionally, the phases described by Tally et al. \citep{tally:2004}
are comparable with the information flow explained by Emigh\citep{emigh:2005}
that illustrated in \autoref{fig:emigh} and explained in \autoref{tab:compilation-phases}.
Phishing attack steps executed by the phisher are also addressed by
Nero et al \citep{nero:2011}. In their study, a successful phishing
attack involves several phases, which can be seen and compared in
\autoref{tab:compilation-phases}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{gfx/emigh}\protect\caption{\label{fig:emigh}Flow of information in phishing attack \citep{emigh:2005}}

\par\end{centering}

\end{figure}


Based on our analysis by looking at the pattern of other phases from
various sources, there is a major similarity between them. Therefore,
we would like to define and design our own phase that are integrated
with three key components suggested by Jakobsson et al. \citep{jakobsson:2006}:
\textit{the lure},\textit{ the hook} and \textit{the catch}. \autoref{fig:Information-flow-phishing}
synthesizes these three components with our phases based on the attacker's
point of view as follows:

- The lure 

1. Phishers prepare the attack 

2. Deliver initial payload to potential victim 

3. Victim taking the bait

- The hook 

4. Prompt for confidential information

5. Disclosed confidential information 

6. Collect stolen information 

- The catch

7. Impersonates victim 

8. Received pay out from the bank 

\begin{figure}
\centering{}Collect stolen information \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{gfx/info-flow-nolie}\protect\caption{\label{fig:Information-flow-phishing}Information flow phishing attack}
\end{figure}


It is important to know that in the phase 3, there are different scenarios
such as: victim might be redirected to a spoofed website; victim may
comply to reply the email; victim may comply to open an attachment(s);
or victim may comply to call by phone. However, in \autoref{fig:Information-flow-phishing}
we have only illustrated the phases if the bait was using a spoofed
website as a method. 

We have reviewed various phases in phishing attacks, and from the
review we have constructed our own phases. In the next section a brief
introduction of the types of phishing is described. We believe that
the general understanding of phishing types helps our main analysis
to characterize phishing email properties.


\section{Types of phishing}

In January 2014, the data of 8300 patients was compromised by US medical
companies \citep{adam:2014}. The data includes names, addresses,
dates of birth and phone numbers. Other than demographic information,
clinical information associated with this data was also stolen, including
social security numbers. In April 2014, phishers successfully stole
US\$163,000 from a US public school based in Michigan \citep{ashley:2014}.
It is said that the email prompting the transfer of money came from
the finance director of the school. In March 2014, Symantec discovered
a phishing attack aimed at Google Drive users \citep{teri:2014}.
The attack involved firstly an incoming email asking for the opening
of document hosted at Google Docs. Users who clicked on the link were
taken to a fraudulent Google login page that prompted Google users
credentials. Interestingly, the URL seemed very convincing because
it was hosted on Google's secure servers. We hypothesize that even
more phishing incidents take place in the financial sector, but sometimes
the news is kept hidden to maintain creditability. With this in mind,
we believe fake websites might be hosted in the network that has more
phishing domains than other networks. In the next section, we will
discuss the general phishing countermeasures.

One may ask: what types of phishing are there? What are the general
types of phishing relevant to our research? Based on the cost of phishing
attacks in \autoref{sec:cost-of-phishing}, the threat of such attacks
is alarming and might evolve in the future with more sophisticated
technique of attacks. For this reason, it might be useful to provide
a brief insight into popular variants of phishing that currently exist.
We will briefly explain the types of phishing that are the most relevant
to our research, based on the work of Jakobsson et al. \citep{jakobsson:2006}.
These types of phishing are strongly related to the phishing definition
that we use, considering phishing is based on the act of deception
by the phishers. 


\subsection{Phishing based on visual similarities}

Since all phishing is based on deception and social engineering, there
is a phishing scenario based on visual similarities. The typical scenario
of phishing based on visual similarities is to send a large amount
of illicit emails containing a call to action asking recipients to
click embedded links \citep{jakobsson:2006}. These variations include
cousin domain attacks. For example, there is a legitimate PayPal website
addressed as wow.paypal.com. Cousin domain attacks confuse potential
victims to believe that wow.paypal-security.com is a subdivision of
the legitimate website due to similar-looking address. Similarly,
homograph attacks create a confusion using similar characters to its
addresses. For example, with wow.paypal.com and wow.paypa1.com, both
addresses look the same but on the second link there is a ``1''
instead of ``l''.

Moreover, phishers may embed a login page directly to the email content.
This suggests the elimination of the need of end-users to click on
a link and phishers do not have to manage an active fraudulent website.
IP addresses are often used instead of human readable host- names
to redirect potential victim to phishing websites and JavaScript is
used to take over the address bar of a browser to make potential victims
believe that they are communicating with the legitimate institution.

Another type of deceptive phishing scheme is rock-phish attacks. They
were held responsible for half of the reported phishing incidents
worldwide in 2005\citep{moore:2007}. These attacks evade email filters
by utilizing random text and GIF images that contain the actual message.
Rock phish attacks also utilize a toolkit that is able to manage several
fraudulent websites in a single domain. Sometimes, deceptive phishing
schemes lead to installation of malware when users visit fraudulent
website. We describe malware-based phishing schemes in the next section. 


\subsection{Malware-based phishing}

Generally, malware-based phishing refers to any type of phishing that
involves installing malicious software onto users' personal computers
\citep{jakobsson:2006}. Subsequently, this malware is used to gather
confidential information from victims instead of spoofing legitimate
websites. This type of phishing incorporates malwares such as keyloggers/screenloggers,
web Trojans and hosts file poisoning.

In the next section, we study general phishing countermeasures in
term of phishing detection and prevention.


\section{Current countermeasures}

There are various types of phishing countermeasures that are implemented
at different levels. Purkait conducted an extensive research reviewing
countermeasures available up until 2012 and analyzing their effectiveness
\citep{purkait}. He suggests that there is a classification of phishing
countermeasures into separate groups, as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Stop phishing at the email level
\item Security and password management toolbars
\item Restriction list
\item Visually differentiate the phishing site
\item Two factor and multi channel authentication
\item Takedown, transaction anomaly detection, log files
\item Anti-phishing training
\item Legal solutions
\end{itemize}
In addition, Parmar et al. suggest that phishing detection can be
classified into two types: user training approach and software classification
approach \citep{parmar:2014}. They illustrate a diagram and a table
that summarizes phishing detection as countermeasures in a broad view\citep{parmar:2014}.
They also argue the advantages and disadvantages of each category
\citep{parmar:2014}. However, as our research mainly focuses on an
analysis of phishing emails based on Cialdini's six principles of
persuasion \citep{cialdini:2001}, we briefly discuss the most relevant
phishing countermeasures: restriction list group (e.g. Phishtank);
machine learning approach (web-based phishing); properties or features
in a phishing email; and anti-phishing training group (e.g. PhishGuru).
In the last section of this chapter, we explore the human factor in
phishing attacks, to see how phishing emails are engineered to gain
the recipient's trust in order to get a response.


\subsection{Phishing detection}

In this subsection, we conduct a literature review related to Phishtank
as restriction list, and machine learning approach to detect spoofed
websites as phishing detection.


\subsubsection{Phishtank}

One of the most common approaches to detect phishing attacks is the
implementation of a restriction list. As the name suggest, it prevents
users from visiting fraudulent websites. One of the efforts to achieve
a restriction list is to derive phishing URLs from Phishtank. Phishtank
is a blacklisting company specifically for phishing URLs and it is
a free community web based where users can report, verify and track
phishing URLs \citep{phishtank}. Phishtank stores phishing URLs in
its database and is widely available for use by other companies for
creating restriction lists. Some of the big companies that use Phishtank's
data are: Yahoo Mail, McAfee, APWG, Web Of Trust, Kaspersky, Opera
and Avira. 

In this section, we discuss what current literatures deal with phishing
data provided by Phishtank. The first step to getting a list of relevant
literatures is by a keyword search in the Scopus online library. Putting
``Phishtank'' as a keyword search results in 12 pieces of literature.
The next step is to read all the abstracts and conclusions of the
resulting keyword search. We decided that 11 pieces of literatures
were relevant to our research. \autoref{tab:phishtank} summarizes
the papers selected and their relevance to Phishtank:

From our literature survey, we know that Phishtank is a crowd-sourced
platform to manage phishing URLs. For that reason Moore et al. aim
to evaluate the wisdom of crowd platforms accommodated by Phishtank
\citep{moore:2008}. Moore et al. suggest that the user participation
is distributed according to power law. It uses model data where the
frequency of an event varies as a power of some attribute of that
event \citep{lai}. Power law also applies to a system when large
is rare and small is common.%
\footnote{http://kottke.org/03/02/weblogs-and-power-laws%
} For example, in the case of individual wealth in a country, 80\%
of all wealth is controlled by 20\% of the population. It makes sense
that in Phishtank's verification system, a single highly active user's
action can greatly impact the system's overall accuracy. \autoref{tab:Comparison-summary}
summarizes the comparison performed by Moore et al. \citep{moore:2008}
between Phishtank and closed proprietary anti-phishing feeds.%
\footnote{The author conceals the identity of the closed proprietary company%
} Moreover, there are some ways to disrupt the Phishtank verification
system, such as: submitting invalid reports accusing legitimate websites;
voting legitimate websites as phish; and voting illegitimate website
as not phish. While all the scenarios described are for the phishers'
benefit, the last scenario is more direct and the first two actions
are a more subtle method, intended to undermine Phishtank's credibility.

To put it briefly, the lesson of crowd-sourced anti-phishing technology
such as Phishtank is that the distribution of user participation matters.
It means that if a few high value participants do something wrong,
it can greatly impact the overall system \citep{moore:2008}. Also,
there is a high probability that bad users could extensively participate
in submitting or verifying URLs in Phishtank.


\subsubsection{Machine learning approach in detecting spoofed website}

The fundamental task of a phishing detection system is to distinguish
between phishing websites and legitimate ones. As we previously discussed,
the aim of phishing attacks is to gather confidential information
from potential victims. To do this, phishers often prompt for this
information through fraudulent websites and masquerade as legitimate
institutions. It does not make sense if phishers created them in a
way very distinctive from its target. It may raise suspicions with
the result of unsuccessful attack. To put it another way, we speculate
that most phishing websites are mostly identical to legitimate websites
to reduce suspicion of potential victims.

In contrast to one of the blacklisting technique we saw in Phishtank
that heavily depend on human verification, researchers make use of
machine learning based technique to automatically distinguish between
phishing and legitimate websites and email. Basically, machine-learning
system is a platform that can learn from previous data and predict
future data with its classification: in this case, phishing and legitimate.
In order for this machine to learn from data, there should be some
kind of inputs to classify the data, which are called features or
characteristics.

Furthermore, there are several learning algorithms to classify the
data, such as logistic regression, random forest, neural networks
and support vector machines. As this particular topic is outside the
scope of our research, we do not discuss the learning algorithm that
is currently implemented. We limit ourselves to introducing three
features that are used in machine learning based detection.

There are vast amount of features that can be used in machine learning
to detect phishing attacks. Literature was selected by keyword search
such as ``phishing + detection + machine learning''. We analyzed
three features: lexical feature, host-based feature and site popularity
feature. Each of these features are introduced briefly below:
\begin{itemize}
\item Lexical features
\end{itemize}
Lexical features (URL-based features) are based on the analysis of
URL structure without any external information. Ma et al. suggest
that the structure URL of phishing may \textquotedblleft look\textquotedblright{}
different to experts \citep{ma:2009}. These features include how
many dots exist, the length, how deep the path traversal the URL has,
or if there any sensitive words present in a URL. For example, with
the URLs https://wow.paypal.com and http://wow.paypal.com.example.com/
or http://login.example.com/ wow.paypal.com/, we can see that the
domain paypal.com is positioned differently, with the first one being
the benign URL. Le et al. suggest we can extract the features related
to the full URL, domain name, directory, file name and argument \citep{le:2011}.
For example, if we want to extract features related to the full URL,
we can define the length of the URL, the number of dots in the URL,
and whether the blacklisted word presents in the URL. The blacklisted
words consist of sensitive words such as confirm, account, login or
webscr.

Lexical features analysis may have performance advantage and reduces
overhead in term of processing and latency, since it only tells the
machine to learn URL structure. 90\% accuracy is achieved when utilizing
lexical features combined with external features such as WHOIS data
\citep{le:2011}. Egan et al. conducted an evaluation of lightweight
classification that includes lexical features and host-based features
in its model \citep{egan:2011}. The study found that the classification
based on these features resulted in extremely high accuracy and low
overheads. \autoref{tab:exist-lex} lists the existing lexical features
that are currently implemented by two different studies \citep{xiang:2011,liu}.
However, Xiang et al.\citep{xiang:2011} pointed out that URL structure
can be manipulated with little cost, causing the features to fail.
For example, attackers could simply remove the embedded domain and
sensitive words to make their phishing URLs look legitimate. Embedded
domain feature examines whether a domain or a hostname is present
in the path segment \citep{xiang:2011}, for example, http://wow.example.net/pathto/wow.paypal.com.
Suspicious URL features examine whether the URL has ``@'' or ``-'',
the present of ``@'' is examined in a URL because when the symbol
``@'' is used, the string to the left will be discarded. Furthermore,
according to \citep{xiang:2011}, not many legitimate websites use
``-'' in their URLs. . There are also plenty of legitimate domains
presented only with IP address and contains more dots. Nevertheless,
lexical analysis would be suitable to use for first phase analysis
of large amounts of data \citep{egan:2011}.

\end{tabular}\protect\caption{\label{tab:exist-lex}Existing lexical features \citep{liu,xiang:2011}}
\end{table}

\begin{itemize}
\item Host based features
\end{itemize}
Since phishers often host phishing websites with less reputable hosting
services and registrars, host-based features are needed to observe
external sources (WHOIS information, domain information, etc.). A
study suggests host-based features have the ability to describe where
phishing websites are hosted, who owns them and how they are managed
\citep{ma:2009}. \autoref{tab:host-based} shows the host-based features
from three studies that are currently used in machine learning phishing
detection. These studies are selected only for example comparison.

\end{tabular}\protect\caption{\label{tab:host-based}Host-based features \citep{ma:2009,ma2:2009,liu,xiang:2011}}
\end{table}


Each of these features matters for phishing detection. However, as
our main objective is an analysis of phishing emails based on Cialdini's
persuasion principles, we do not describe each of these features in
detail. It is noteworthy that some of the features are subset of other
features. For instance, autonomous system number (ASN), IP country
and number of registration information are derived from WHOIS information.
Nevertheless, we only explain the few of them that we consider the
most crucial:
\begin{enumerate}
\item WHOIS information: Since phishing websites and hacked domains are
often created at a relatively young age, this information could provide
the registration date, update date and expiration date. Domain ownership
would also be included; therefore, a set of malicious websites with
the same individual could be identified. 
\item 2. IP address information: Justin Ma et al. used this information
to identify whether or not an IP address is blacklisted \citep{ma2:2009,ma:2009}.
Besides the corresponding IP address, it provides records like nameservers
and mail exchange servers. This allows the classifier to be able to
flag other IP addresses within the same IP prefix and ASN. 
\item Domain name properties: these include time to live (TTL) of DNS associated
with a hostname. PTR record (reverse DNS lookup) of a domain could
also be derived whether it is valid or not.\end{enumerate}
\begin{itemize}
\item Site popularity features
\end{itemize}
Site popularity could be an indicator whether a website is phishy
or not. It makes sense if a phishing website has much less traffic
or popularity than a legitimate website. According to \citep{xiang:2011},
some of the features indicated in \autoref{tab:popular-features}
are well performed when incorporated with machine learning system.

\par\end{centering}

\end{table}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Page in top search results: this feature was originally used by \citep{zhang:2007}
to find whether or not a website shows up in the top N search result.
If it is not the case, the website could be flagged as phishy since
phishing websites have less chance of being crawled \citep{xiang:2011}.
We believe this feature is similar to the Number of external links
feature since both of them are implying the same technique.
\item PageRank: this technique is originally introduced by Google to map
which websites are popular and which are not, based on the value from
0 to 10. According to \citep{xiang:2011}, the intuitive rationale
of this feature is that phishing websites often have very low PageRank
due to their ephemeral nature and very low incoming links that are
redirected to them. This feature is similar to Real traffic rank feature
employed by \citep{liu} where such feature can be acquired from alexa.com.
\item Page in top results when searching copyright company name and domain/hostname
features are complement features of Page in top search results feature
with just different queries. Moreover, we believe they are also similar
to Domain in reputable sites list feature since they are determining
the reputation of a website. The first two features can be identified
by querying google.com \citep{xiang:2011} and the latter feature
can be obtained from amazon.com \citep{liu}. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{\label{sub:Stop-phishing-at}Stop phishing at email level}

In order to stop phishing at email level, phishing email properties
or features should be investigated. Chandrasekaran et al. and Drake
et al. \citep{chandrasekaran:2006,drake2004anatomy} specify the structure
of phishing emails properties as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Spoofing of online banks and retailers. Impersonation of legitimate
institutions may occur at the email level. Phishers may design a fake
email to resemble the reputable company in order to gain users' trust.
\item Link in the text is different from the destination. A link(s) contained
in the email message usually appears different than the actual link
destination. This portrays hidden URL and this method is used to trick
users to believe that the email is legitimate.
\item Using IP addresses instead of URLs. Sometimes phishers may hide the
link in the message by presenting it as IP address instead of URL.
\item Generalization in addressing recipients. As phishing emails are distributed
by large number of recipients, the email is often not personalized,
unlike a legitimate email that address its recipient with personalized
information such as the last four digits of their account.
\item Usage of well-defined situational contexts to lure victims. Situational
contexts such as false urgency and threat are a common method to influence
the decision making of the recipients.
\end{enumerate}
Ma et al. experimented with seven properties to consider in phishing
emails: the total number of links; total numbers of invisible links;
whether the link that appears in the message is different than the
actual destination; the existence of forms; whether scripts exist
within an email; total appearance of blacklisted words in the body;
and the total appearance of blacklisted words in the subject \citep{ma2009detecting}.
Based on this survey, we established phishing email properties as
variables in order to classify our data in \autoref{sub:variables}.


\subsection{Phishing prevention}

Phishing attacks aim to bypass technological countermeasures by manipulating
users' trust and can lead to monetary losses. Therefore, human factors
play a big part in the phishing taxonomy, especially in the organizational
environment. Human factor in phishing taxonomy is comprised of education,
training and awareness \citep{frauenstein:2013}. \autoref{fig:holistic}
illustrates where human factors play a part in phishing threats \citep{frauenstein:2013}.
User's awareness of phishing has been explored by several studies
\citep{james:2005,frauenstein:2013,emigh:2005,kumaraguru:2008,jansson:2013,dodge:2007}
as preventive measures against phishing attacks. According to ISO/IEC
27002 \citep{frauenstein:2013}\citep{organization:2005}, information
security awareness is important and it has been a critical success
factor in mitigating security vulnerabilities that attack user's trust.
One approach to hopefully prevent phishing attacks is to implement
an anti-phishing warning/indicator. Dhamija et al. suggest that users
often ignore security indicators, thus making them ineffective \citep{dhamija2006phishing}.
Even if users notice the security indicators, they often do not understand
what they represent. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering{}\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{\string"gfx/human factor\string".png}\protect\caption{\label{fig:holistic}Holistic anti-phishing framework \citep{frauenstein:2013}}
\end{figure}


Moreover, the inconsistency of positioning on different browsers makes
it difficult to identify phishing \citep{kirlappos:2012}. Schechter
et al. pointed out that 53\% of their study participants were still
attempting to provide confidential information even after their task
was interrupted by strong security warning \citep{schechter:2007}.
This suggests that an effective phishing education must be added as
a complementary strategy to complete technical anti-phishing measures.

Phishing education for online users often includes instructing people
not to click links in an email, ensure that the SSL is present and
to verify that the domain name is correct before giving information.
This traditional practice evidently has not always been effective
\citep{emigh:2005}. One may ask, therefore, what makes phishing education
effective. A study suggests that in order for online users to be aware
of phishing threats, they need to be really engaged so that they understand
how vulnerable they are \citep{mansfield:2013}. To do this, simulated
phishing attacks are often performed internally in an organization.
\autoref{fig:simulated} shows a simulated phishing email and website
carried out by Kumaraguru et al. from PhishGuru \citep{kumaraguru:2009}.
This scenario delivers the ultimate teachable moment if they fall
for these attacks.

\begin{figure}[H]

}\protect\caption{\label{fig:simulated}Simulated phishing attack \citep{kumaraguru:2009}}


\end{figure}


Phishguru is a security training system operated by Wombat security
technology that teaches users not to be deceived by phishing attempts
through simulation of phishing attacks \citep{phishguru}. They claimed
Phishguru provides more effective training than traditional training
as it is designed to be more engaging. \autoref{fig:em-training}
illustrates how embedded phishing training was presented by PhishGuru.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering{}\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{\string"gfx/phishing training\string".png}\protect\caption{\label{fig:em-training}Embedded phishing training \citep{kumaraguru:2009}}
\end{figure}


Kumaraguru et al. investigated the effectiveness of embedded training
methodology in a real world situation \citep{kumaraguru:2009}. They
indicated that 28 days after training, users trained by PhishGuru
were less likely to click the link presented in the simulated phishing
email than those who were not trained. They also find that users who
trained twice were less likely to give information to simulated fraudulent
websites than users who were trained once. Moreover, they argue that
the training does not decrease the users' willingness to click on
the links from legitimate emails; it is less likely a trained user
gave a false positive when he or she was requested to give information
by true legitimate emails \citep{kumaraguru:2009}. This suggests
that a user training strategy or effective phishing education is necessary
to improve phishing awareness, especially in organizational settings.


\section{\label{sec:Human-factor-and}Human factor and persuasion}

Phishing attacks generally aim to manipulate end users to comply with
the phisher's request. Such manipulation in phishing attacks is achieved
by social engineering. This means that human element is tightly involved
with phishing. But how do phishers compose such deception? Why are
online users gullible to these attacks? 

Kevin Mitnick, who obtained millions of dollars by performing social
engineering techniques, is probably the best known person who had
used the social engineering technique to carry out attacks. His book
entitled ``The art of deception: Controlling the Human Element of
Security'' \citep{mitnik:2001} defined social engineering as follows:
\begin{quote}
``Using influence and persuasion to deceive people by convincing
them that the attacker is someone he is not, or by manipulation. As
a result, the social engineer is able to take advantage of people
to obtain information, or to persuade them to perform an action item,
with or without the use of technology.''
\end{quote}
From Mitnick's definition we can learn that people are the main target
of the attack. He specifies some of the important tools used by the
attackers such as influence and persuasion.

Cialdini suggests that there are six basic principles of persuasion
\citep{cialdini:2001}; that is, the technique of making people grant
to one's request. These principles are:\textit{ reciprocation, consistency,
social proof, likeability, authority and scarcity}. Reciprocation
is the norm that obligates individuals to repay in kind what they
have received, return the favor or adjustment to a smaller request\foreignlanguage{english}{
\citep{cialdini:2001}. Consistency is a public commitment where people
commit to the decision they have made \citep{workman:2008}\citep{cialdini:2001}.
Social proof is when people follow the behavior of their peer group,
role models or important others because it is generally \textquotedbl{}fashionable\textquotedbl{}
\citep{workman:2008}. Stajano et al. suggest people will let their
guard down when everybody around them appears to share the same risk
\citep{stajano2011understanding}. Likeability is when people trust
those they find attractive or credible \citep{workman:2008,cialdini:2001}.
When trust is achieved, compliance to grant a request may take place.
While it is our human nature not to question authority, it can be
used to cause fear, where people obey commands to avoid negative consequences
such as: losing a privilege; losing something valuable; and fear of
punishment, humiliation or condemnation \citep{cialdini:2001,workman:2008}.
Stajano et al. suggest that scarcity is related to the time principle:
that is, when we are under time pressure to make an important choice,
we tend to have less reasoning in making a decision \citep{stajano2011understanding}. }

The human being as the \textquotedblleft weakest link'' in computer
security has been exploited for a long time. Security designers blame
users and complain that: ``the system I designed would be secure,
if only users were less gullible\textquotedblright{} \citep{stajano2011understanding}.
Stajano et al. stated that: \textquotedblleft a wise security designer
would seek a robust solution which acknowledges the existence of these
vulnerabilities as unavoidable consequence of human nature and actively
build countermeasures that prevent this exploitation\textquotedblright{}
\citep{stajano2011understanding}. With this in mind, the exploration
of persuasion principles is congruent with our research goal. Cialdini's
six persuasion principles are the foundation of our research.
