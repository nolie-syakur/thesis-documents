, we processed our data into several steps.
 Firstly, we collect our raw data from fraudehelpdesk in the form of suspected
 phishing email reports.
 Next, we performed our data categorization and we divided it into three
 categorization tasks.
 The next step, we determined what variables are needed for our analysis.
 Next step, we excecuted our data classification into these variables, so
 that we could reconstruct into SPSS readable dataset.
 Lastly, we conducted our SPSS analysis to answer our hypotheses.

\begin_layout Subsection
Raw data collection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data gathered from fraudehelpdesk.nl by my supervisor, Elmer Lastdrager
 MSc.
 in the form of phishing emails which were reported between august 2013
 and december 2013.
 The data consists of 8444 suspected phishing emails in total that we categorize
d based on the language, whether the reported phishing email is in Dutch
 or English language.
 The data was categorized in the confidential environment, which mean we
 only analyzed the data in Zilverling building of University of Twente.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Data categorization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We manually categorized 8444 suspected phishing emails by sorting all the
 emails by the subject so that we could tell which emails were being distributed
 with the exact same content.
 We then examined individual email which has no or empty subject and determined
 in which language it was delivered.
 Initial categorization resulted as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
7756 suspected phishing emails in Dutch language
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
688 suspected phishing emails in English language
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Within 688 suspected phishing emails in English language we further categorized
 based on phishing, spam and unknown emails.
 We label this process as 1st precision categorization.
 Phishing category is determined which email were indeed phishing, spam
 category is specified which email were spam and unknown category is established
 by the following guidelines:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The email which has no content, whether it was removed automatically by
 antivirus program.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The email which is presented in the language other than Dutch or English.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The process is resulted as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
486 phishing emails
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
150 spam emails
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
52 unknown emails
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To get a further precision from the 1st precision categorization, we executed
 2nd precision categorization within 688 suspected phishing emails in English
 language.
 This process is resulted as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
440 phishing emails
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
180 spam emails
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
50 unknown emails
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
18 legitimate emails
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Interestingly, we have 18 legitimate emails that were mistakenly reported
 as phishes or false positive.
 Although they are only 18 false positive, this suggest there are still
 misinterpretation of fraudulent email in our society.
 From this point we would only code 440 phishing emails to an excel sheet
 with necessary variables so that we could convert it into SPSS readable
 file.
 From 440 phishing emails, we perform query search which email that has
 a duplicated content.
 Query search resulted in 207 unique phishing emails.
 At the end, we will only analyze 207 unique phishing emails in our corpus.

\begin_layout Subsection
Data Classification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We classified our data accordingly into our variables.
 As a result, usable dataset has been made to be statistically analysed.
 Data classification is conducted in a straightforward way.
 For example if phishing email has a PDF attachment, we put 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

1
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in our 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

PDFattachment
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 variable.
 Similarly, if phishing email has a hyperlink in the content, we put 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

1
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in our 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ContainHyperlink

Synthesizing Cialdini's principles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Part of our analysis, we tried to synthesize phishing emails dataset with
 Cialdini’s principles titled “The science of persuasion”.
 The decision making and the rationale in this process are achieved based
 our perspective of Cialdini’s principles as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Reciprocation: The norm that obligates individuals to repay in kind what
 they have received.
 Return the favor.
 Adjustment to smaller request 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "cialdini:2001"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Consistency: Public commitment.
 When people become psychologically become vested in a decision they have
 made 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "workman:2008"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Social proof: When people model the behavior of their peer group, role models,
 important others or because it is generally "fashionable" 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "workman:2008"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Likeability: When people trust and comply with requests from others who
 they find attractive or are perceived as credible and having special expertise
 or abilities such as sports figures or actors they like 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "workman:2008"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Authority: It can be used to engender fear, where people obey commands to
 avoid negative consequences such as losing a privilege or something of
 value, punishment, humiliation or condemnation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "workman:2008"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Scarcity: based on the principle of reactance, where people respond to perceived
 shortages by placing greater psychological value on perceived scarce items
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "workman:2008"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Reciprocation
\emph default
: When a phisher sends an email containing a message that perceived as a
 request or obligation towards the recipient to “return the favor”.
 It might be normal for an individual to feel “obligated” to return the
 favor for things or information that he/she deemed to be valuable.
 For example in the phishing email context, when PayPal has detected there
 are suspicious activities on our account, we sometimes believe that PayPal
 has done a good job in detecting security risk on their system and we feel
 “obligated” to return the favor of that valuable information.
 Another example, if the sender gave the information that they have added
 “extra security” on their system so that we also feel obligated to grant
 their request.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Consistency
\emph default
: When a phishing email contains a message that perceived to request recipient’s
 “consistency” on a decision they have made.
 For example in the phishing email context, when a hotel agent asks us to
 review the payment details of our reservation that we have previously made,
 we might feel committed or agreed to review the payment details that has
 been given.
 Another example, if Facebook gave a link to change your password that you
 requested previously to change it.
 It might be not applicable to those who are not requesting password previously,
 but we believe it will impact to those who are committed to change the
 password previously.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Social proof
\emph default
: When a phishing email contains an affiliation of other people that they
 deemed to be “fashionable”.
 For example, when someone tells us that there are a hundreds of other people
 who use particular system, so we might want to agree to use it as well
 just because a lot of other people use it as well.
 Another example, when Facebook give information that someone wants to be
 our friend, and we knew who that someone is.
 We might tend to follow that request and click the link to accept the request.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Likeability
\emph default
: When a phishing email contains a message that attracts recipient to comply
 the sender’s request based the reference on something or someone that likeable
 for the recipient.
 Cialdini [1] identified that people usually “trust those they like”.
 For example, if someone is asking us to download and listen to a music
 that Michael Jackson made, we might be attracted to download and listen
 to it just because we happen to love Michael Jackson music.
 It is like someone is asking us to watch a concert and he/she said, “Coldplay
 will be there”, if we are devoted fan of Coldplay, we might find it very
 interesting.
 Another example, when a sender gives compliments to us or committed to
 help us to safeguard our account from the hackers, we tend to think that
 the sender cares about our safety, which is good for us, and consequently
 it might attract us to comply with the sender’s request.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Authority
\emph default
: When a phishing email contains logo or image or signature or anything
 that looks like legitimate institutions.
 It can be used to makes it look trustworthy so that the recipient might
 accept and obey the sender’s request.
 For example, when an email is presenting somehow authentic looking signature
 like “Copyright 2013 PayPal, Inc.
 All rights reserved” or PayPal logo.
 Cialdini [1] stated authoritative persuasion could be achieved by only
 presenting “aura of legitimacy”.
 Another example, when the content of the email stated that it is from “System
 Administrator” asking for password update.
 It would be not authoritative if only random people asking us to change
 our password.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Scarcity
\emph default
: When a phishing email contains a message that tells a recipient to react
 or respond to scarce/turns-into scarce items or things or privileges.
 For example in the phishing email context, if a sender tells us that he/she
 will suspend/deactivate/limit our account if not respond to his/her request,
 we might want to respond to their request because we are worried we will
 not able to access our account again or in other words our account become
 scarce or limited.

RQ1: What are the characteristics of the reported phishing emails
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we look at the statistics, we find that 36.2% of the reported phishing
 emails have an attachment(s) included within its content, while 63.8% does
 not have attachment.
 In addition, we also look at what types of attachment does one has.
 We find that 1% have PDF attachment, 28.6% have ZIP attachment, 4.3% have
 HTML attachment and 1.9% of them we are not sure what type of attachments
 they have, but we determined that the attachment element is still there
 if the request to open attachment within its content is presence.
