\selectlanguage{english}%
With the advancement of information technology in the modern generation,
the evolution of the digital era has become more mature in the sense
of effectiveness and ease for societies. People can sell and buy goods,
conduct banking activities and even participate in political activities
such as elections online. Trusted entities such as financial institutions
generally offer their products and services to the public through
the Internet. Furthermore, modern technology has greatly impacted
our society in different ways, such as the way we communicate with
each other. Nowadays, we are no longer need to use a computer to send
an email. We can just use our smartphone, which we carry every day
in our pockets, with internet connectivity to send an email. As a
result, society has been utilizing technological means such as emails,
websites, online payment systems and social networks to achieve their
tasks efficiently, affordably and in a more focus way. However, the
advancement in information and communication technology has been a
double-edged sword. As the internet increasingly becomes more accessible,
people tend to share more about themselves and as a consequence, it
becomes easier to get personal information about someone on the Internet.
Cyber criminals see this opportunity as a way to manipulate consumers
and exploit their confidential information such as usernames, passwords,
bank account information, credit card or social security numbers.
Personalized information about someone such as email addresses, phone
numbers, birthdates, relationships or workplaces can be obtained from
the Internet. Consequently, cyber criminals can compose an attack
in a personalized way to persuade intended victims to grant their
malicious requests.

One particular type of cyber crimes is called phishing. There are
many many possible incentives that drive phishing attacks including
illicit corporate espionage, political power, and, most common of
all, financial benefits. The attacker generally masquerades as a legitimate
institution to trick users into disclosing personal, financial or
computer account information \citep{jakobsson:2006}. The attacker
can then use this information for criminal activities such as identity
theft or fraud. To manipulate unsuspecting victims, the attacker often
uses emails and websites as the techniques to execute the attacks
\citep{jakobsson:2006}\citep{dhamija2006phishing}. The practice
of utilizing emails and websites is indeed useful as communication
media. However, they can also accommodate deceptive attacks such as
phishing as a form of social engineering and deception \citep{jakobsson:2006}\citep{blythe2011f}\citep{dhamija2006phishing}\citep{james:2005}\citep{jagatic2007social}.
Social engineering involves the techniques used to deceive people
in order to get compliance and response by specific actions that will
disclose their sensitive information, such as replying to a fake email
or clicking a link within an email \citep{mitnik:2001}. Moreover,
phishers often use persuasion techniques to manipulate potential victims
to engage in certain emotions such as excitement and fear as well
as interpersonal relationships, such as trust and commitments, to
divert users' attention \citep{workman:2008}. Such persuasive influence
might be delivered through phone calls, text messages, private messages
or emails as ways to distract recipients' decisions.

\section{Problem statement}

\selectlanguage{english}%
Countermeasures against phishing attacks via email can be technical
or non-technical. One of technical approaches to detect phishing email
is achieved by distinguishing between phishing and original emails
based on their structural properties, using machine learning \citep{chandrasekaran:2006}.
One of the non-technical approaches to defending against phishing
attacks is to make people aware of the threats. Security awareness
concerning phishing attacks might be achieved by embedded training
methods that teach people about phishing during their normal use of
email \citep{kumaraguru2007protecting}. 

The common characteristics of a phishing email include structural
properties such as misleading hyperlinks and misleading header information
\citep{zhang:2006,zhang:2007}. To make a phishing email effective,
its content requires the intended victim to urgently act upon it;
for example, an email that informs about account termination if the
recipient does not respond or perform an action within a limited time.
In order to obtain compliance from the recipient in a phishing email,
persuasion is used as an underlying technique to get a positive response
from an intended victim \citep{workman:2008}.

The success of a phishing attack through distributed emails is determined
by the response of the unsuspecting recipients. User decisions to
click a link or open an attachment in an email might be influenced
by how strong a phisher can persuade the intended victim. Phishers
often misuse persuasion techniques to get positive responses from
the recipients. Unfortunately, not many studies have included persuasion
techniques as important aspects in phishing emails. Consequently,
not many people are aware of the existence of persuasion in the emails
they are getting. Current phishing email countermeasures are greatly
rely on the technical aspect alone rather than integrating the technical
aspect with psychological aspects such as persuasion. Based on Cialdini's
persuasion principles, there are six basic tendencies of human behavior
that can generate a positive response; reciprocation, consistency,
social proof, likeability, authority and scarcity \citep{cialdini:2001}.
As we mention earlier, persuasion techniques can also be exploited
by the phishers to get positive responses from potential victims.
Based on this reasoning, we will conduct a quick scan of the existing
studies regarding persuasion techniques in phishing emails.

We performed a combination of query strings such as ``phishing''
and ``persuasion'' to search based on title, abstract, and keyword
fields in the Scopus database and we also searched based on topic
in the Web of Science database. As we adopt the concept of persuasion
based on Cialdini's six principles, we also search ``phishing''
in TAK(Title, Abstract, Keywords) fields and ``Cialdini'' in the
references field. From \autoref{tab:Query-searches-in}, we can see
that two papers that occur in both databases \citep{wright2014research,kaivanto2014effect}
and one paper appearing in both queries \citep{wright2014research}.
However, Sharma's paper is retracted for having non-original materials,
so we will not conduct a review of it. We will describe what the remaining
papers do and how they are different from our research in the following
points:

\begin{itemize}
\item As observed by Kavianto, the overall security risk in an organization
depends on its individuals' behavioral decisions to respond to security
threats such as phishing attacks. Kavianto also found that an individual's
behavioral decisions can be separated into two levels: tradeoffs between
uncertainties, losses and benefits; and their susceptibility to persuasion
techniques \citep{cialdini:2001} and emotion \citep{kaivanto2014effect}.
Kavianto develops a model of an individual's behavioral decisions
in aggregate levels \citep{kaivanto2014effect}. The outcome of the
study is the possibility of incorporating individual-level behavioral
biases into the analysis of system level risk (i.e. network security
risk). Although Kavianto identifies that successful deception can
be linked with how persuasion techniques are used by the perpetrator,
no actual data of phishing emails is analyzed.
\item Blythe et al. used four methods to show how people are often susceptible
to phishing attacks \citep{blythe2011f}. These four methods are:
content analysis; online surveys; interview with blind email users;
and literary analysis \citep{blythe2011f}. Content analysis suggests
that phishing email is advancing with better spelling and grammar
and supported by the present of visual graphics such as logos. Online
surveys shows that while their participants are computer literate,
they are not always successful in detecting phishing, even more so
with the presence of logo. Blythe et al. found that blind email users
are more attentive to the context of the email that is presented \citep{blythe2011f}.
Thus, the detection of phishing by blind email users is higher than
non-disabled email users. As it became clear that careful reading
is the core process of identifying phishing emails, Blythe et al.
then consider a phishing email as literature \citep{blythe2011f}.
Literary analysis shows that the phishers who imitate personalized
email from banking and security services allow phishing emails to
remain successful, as they exploit people\textquoteright s anxieties
in terms of the content of the email itself. Although Blythe et al.
conducted content analysis and found that literary analysis was ``very''
persuasive, they did not conduct their content analysis based on persuasion
techniques. Instead, they based the content analysis on structural
properties such as sender, grammatical error, logos and style.
\item Ghorbani et al. argue that some general approaches designed by attackers
to obtain sensitive information to exploit a computer system using
social engineering \citep{Ghorbani20101}. Social engineering includes
aggressive persuasion and interpersonal skills to obtain unauthorized
access to a system. Moreover, Ghorbani et al. discussed network attack
taxonomy, probes, privilege escalation attacks, Denial of Service
(DOS) attacks, Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) attacks, and
worm and routing attacks \citep{Ghorbani20101}. However, their study
only discussed these network attacks in considerable detail without
addressing persuasion theory and little explanation in terms of phishing
emails.
\item The paper of Krombholz et al. provides a taxonomy of well-known social
engineering attacks and studies the overview of advanced social engineering
attacks on knowledge workers \citep{krombholz2013social}. What they
meant by knowledge worker here is the worker that characterized knowledge
as their capital. The paper used Cialdini's persuasion principles
as the background study of social engineering. The taxonomy was classified
based on attack channel (e.g. emails, instant messenger, social network,
etc.), the operator (e.g. human, software), different types of social
engineering (e.g. phishing, shoulder surfing, dumpster diving, etc.),
and specific attack scenarios. Krombholz et al. provide an overview
of social engineering attacks by creating a taxonomy to support further
development of social engineering attack countermeasures \citep{krombholz2013social}. 
\item Herzberg et al. tested the effectiveness of different defense mechanisms
that use forcing and negative training functions \citep{herzberg2013forcing}.
Their methods involved using an online exercise submission system
called ``Submit'' to simulate phishing attacks. It involved a population
of \textasciitilde{}400 students and two years of observation. Their
outcomes claimed that forcing and negative training functions are
very effective in both prevention and detection. However, their defense
mechanisms do not consider on the persuasion techniques at all, or
analyze data from real phishing emails.
\item Vishwanath et al. tested the individual differences in phishing vulnerability
within the integrated information processing model \citep{vishwanath2011people}.
The model focuses on four contextual factors: the individual level
of involvement; domain specific knowledge; technological efficacy;
and email load. The method involves 161 samples. The conclusion of
their study is to show the model can be used as an insight into how
individuals get phished. However, they do not consider persuasion
principles in terms of their contextual factors, or analyze real phishing
attacks. This suggests that persuasion techniques do not play an important
role in determining the success of phishing attacks.
\item Kawakami et al. developed an e-learning system that uses animation
for information security education \citep{kawakami2010development}.
The paper only mentions the commitment and consistency based on Cialdini's
principles to be used to influence people to take their e-learning
system as a security education.
\item An interesting paper from Wright et al. which analyzes how people
are influenced by Cialdini's six persuasion principles in phishing
messages \citep{wright2014research}\citep{cialdini:2001}. The study
involved creating phishing messages that represented persuasion principles
and testing them on 2,600 participants to see how many would respond
\citep{wright2014research}. The outcome of the study is that liking,
social proof, scarcity and reciprocation do increase the likelihood
of recipients responding to phishing emails \citep{wright2014research}.
Despite the fact that Wright et al. used the same persuasion principles
as our study \citep{cialdini:2001}, they tried to find the implication
of persuasion principles from the users' perspectives. Although the
direction of their paper is different, it can be a complimentary to
our study.
\item Workman proposed a peripheral route of persuasion model and conducted
a behavioral study based on this model \citep{workman:2008}. The
model relates basic human factors that respond to persuasion techniques
based on Cialdini\textquoteright s six principles \citep{cialdini:2001}.
These factors are; normative commitment, continuance commitment, affective
commitment, trust, fear, and reactance. Workman created six hypotheses
to investigate whether the participants who are prone to these factors
exhibit a higher risk to phishing attacks \citep{workman:2008}. Based
on Workman's measurement, all six hypotheses are accepted. The data
was obtained by a questionnaire and objective observation involving
850 participants. In the end, a total of 612 participants responded.
The conclusion is that the participants who have the tendency for
these factors are more vulnerable to phishing attacks \citep{workman:2008}.
For instance, one of Workman's hypotheses stated that: ``people who
are more reactance, will succumb to social engineering more frequently
than those who are more resistance.'' This suggests that Workman
tried to measure the implication of persuasion principles from the
users' perspectives as well. 
\item We found only one paper that was similar to our study \citep{kim2013understanding}.
Apart from a different dataset, Kim et al. conducted a content analysis
of phishing emails based on message argument quality rather than Cialdini's
six persuasion principles \citep{kim2013understanding}\citep{cialdini:2001}.
They did not relate structural phishing properties such as URLs, attachments,
usage of HTML, targeted sector and reason used with their persuasion
theory. The message argument quality includes: rational appeals, emotional
appeals, motivational appeals and time pressure \citep{kim2013understanding}.
The reasoning of rational appeals is determined by direct evidence
of causality between events. For example, \textquotedblleft a few
days ago our online banking security team observed invalid logins
to customer accounts. Thus, you are required to re-confirm your online
access for account verification.\textquotedblright{} This can be mapped
as reciprocation based on Cialdini's persuasion principles \citep{cialdini:2001}.
An emotional appeal is defined by fear, sadness, guilt, anger, happiness,
affection and humor. In our study this can be mapped into authority
or likeability. Time pressure is identified by the limited amount
of time the recipient has to respond to a phishing email. This also
can be mapped into the scarcity principle. One of the factors representing
motivational appeals is ``the need of belongingness'' which also
can be portrayed as the need of being part of a group to forms bond
with others. Based on our understanding, we can map motivational appeals
such as the social proof principle. However, there is no conception
of message argument quality that can be mapped to the consistency
principle. \autoref{tab:A-map-of} indicates our mapping from message
argument quality into Cialdini's persuasion principles \citep{cialdini:2001}.
One interesting result from the study is that the number of time pressure
emails (42\%, n=285) is not as high as they expected. The study concludes
that phishers indeed incorporate rational, emotional and motivational
appeals in their dataset. However, the conception of persuasion theory
adopted by Kim et al. is different from our study. We argue that diversity
of persuasion theory needs to be incorporated to achieve an objective
conclusion.

Based on the review, we can say that the studies conducted by Workman
\citep{workman:2008} and Wright et al. \citep{wright2014research}
are similar. Both of them have tried to find the implication of persuasion
principles from the users' perspectives, which can be complementary
to our study. 

We have conducted individual investigations on all papers found in
both databases. The finding shows not only the different measurement
instruments and methods but also the foundation of persuasion theory
between the current studies and our study. The low number of results
from the query searches also indicate that there is little academic
research into study persuasion techniques and phishing area. Therefore,
a real world analysis of phishing emails characterization based on
persuasion techniques is needed to bridge this gap. This characterization
can show to what extent persuasion techniques are used in phishing
emails. Our research fills the void as a milestone towards countermeasures
against phishing attacks with an insight of psychological aspects.


\section{Research goal}

The main goal of this research is to characterize phishing email properties
by considering persuasion principles, finding the association between
generic properties and persuasion principles. These generic properties
consist of phishing email structural properties or features based
on the literature survey findings. Each of these properties and each
of the persuasion principles are introduced as variables in our methodology.
We look for frequency and relationship involving these variables.
This relationship can be used to show a different perspective of phishing
email characteristics considering the persuasive elements within its
content. The analysis of persuasion principles in phishing emails
can also be used to generate a new automated method of detecting phishing
emails as one of the primary delivery techniques of phishing attacks.


\section{Research Questions}

To meet the goal, we formulated two main research questions as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item RQ1: What are the characteristics of phishing emails?
\item RQ2: To what extent are persuasion principles used in phishing emails?
\end{itemize}
\selectlanguage{american}%
Several aspects of phishing email characteristics and hypotheses related
to the research questions are addressed in detail in detail in \autoref{chap:research-questions}.

\selectlanguage{english}%

\section{Structures}

This research project is structured as follows: 

Chapter 2 describes background and literature reviews about phish-
ing in general. The subsections are: a general understanding of what
is phishing in terms of history and definition; an overview of its
damage in terms of money; an exploration of its modus operandi based
on phishing stages or phases; general phishing countermeasures; and
lastly the human factor in phishing.

In Chapter 3, we present the rationale of our main research questions
and hypotheses. It includes what aspects to be considered to answer
the characteristics of phishing emails based on persuasion principles
in the dataset and the motivation of our hypotheses to support our
research questions.

In Chapter 4, we discuss our main data analysis and results. It includes
the details of research methodology that we conducted as well as the
results of our analysis.

Lastly, in Chapter 5 we present our discussion and conclusion of the
research project, how the research questions are answered along with
the recommendations, the limitations, and how these limitations could
become the basis of future research.\selectlanguage{american}%
