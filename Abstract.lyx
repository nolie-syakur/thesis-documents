Abstract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Valuable information, such as login credentials and personal sensitive informati
on, can be acquired by exploiting vulnerabilities within the userâ€™s understandin
g of a system, and particularly a lack of in-depth understanding of the
 user interface.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the barrier to abuse system vulnerabilities has been improved significantly
 with time, attacking users' psyche has rapidly become a more efficient
 and effective alternative.
 The usage of email as a media electronic of communication has been exploited
 by phishers to deliver their attacks.
 
\lang english
The success of a phishing attack through distributed emails is determined
 by the response of the unsuspecting recipients.

\lang american
 Persuasion techniques often used to obscure users in making decisions to
 response or not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To protect users from phishing attacks in the email level, system designers
 and security professionals need to understand how phishers use persuasion
 techniques in phishing emails.
 In this thesis we present an improved understanding of persuasion techniques
 in phishing emails.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Our research is aimed to understand the characteristics of phishing emails
 considering persuasion techniques in the real world analysis which has
 not been done yet.
 The analysis consists of finding relationships between persuasion techniques
 and generic structural properties of phishing emails.
