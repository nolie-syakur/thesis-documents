Problem statement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
With the enormous growing trends of information technology in modern generation,
 the evolution of digital era has become more mature in the sense of effectivene
ss and easiness for societies.
 Trusted entities such as financial institutions may offer their products
 and services to the public through the Internet.
 It has greatly impacted our society in different ways, for example the
 way we communicate with each other.
 In the recent days, we are no longer need to use computer to send an email,
 we can just use our smartphone, which we carry every day in our pockets,
 with internet connectivity to send an email.
 Consequently, human society has been enthusiastically eager to utilize
 technology means such as emails, websites, online payment system, social
 networks to achieve their tasks efficiently, affordable and more relevant.
 However, the advancement in information and communication technology has
 been a double-edged sword.
 It becomes easier to get personal information about someone in the cyber
 world.
 Cyber criminals see this opportunity as a way to manipulate consumers and
 exploit their confidential information such as usernames, passwords, bank
 account information, credit card or social security numbers.
 Personalized information about someone such as email address, phone number,
 birth date, relationships or work place might be obtained from the internet
 such as online social network sites.
 As a result, cyber criminals can compose an attack in a personalized way
 to persuade intended victim to grant their malicious requests.

One of the well known cyber crimes is called phishing.
 One of the objectives of phishing attack is to gain a financial benefit
 by masquerading legitimate institutions

.
 Evidently, phishing techniques is often associated with bogus emails and
 websites

.
 Moreover, studies suggest that the essence of this malicious behavior is
 the art of pretext social engineering and deception

 Social engineering involves the techniques used in order to manipulate
 people into responding to perform an action or disclosing sensitive information
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "mitnik:2001"

\end_inset

.
 Social engineers often attempt to persuade potential victims to engage
 in some short of emotion such as excitement and fear as well as interpersonal
 relationship such as trust and commitments 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "workman:2008"

.
 Such deception and social engineering attacks might be delivered through
 phone calls, text messages, private messages or emails as a medium to distract
 recipients' decisions.

\lang english
To make phishing email efficient, its context might require the intended
 victim to urgently act upon it, for example an email informs about suspending
 an account if recipient does not respond or perform an action within a
 limited time.
 In order to gain trust from recipient in a phishing email, persuasion technique
s are used to get a positive response from intended victim.
 Several countermeasures have been studied to detect phishing emails, such
 as the technique of looking for bit string that are previously determined
 as spams and phishing emails 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "wardman:2009"

.
 The common characteristics of bogus email sent by the phishers would be
 misleading hyperlinks and misleading header information 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, one of the non technical approaches to defense against phishing
 attacks is to make people aware of the threats.
 Security awareness in regards of phishing attacks might be achieved by
 aiding an education to the public to ignore links within an email, even
 though the source of the email appear to be legitimate

\lang english
The success of phishing attack through distributed emails is determined
 by the response of the unsuspecting recipients.
 User decisions to click a link or open an attachment in an email might
 be influenced by how strong a phisher can persuade the intended victim.
 However, current literatures so far show an absence of real world analysis
 in characterizing phishing email properties by considering persuasion technique
s, which it might be important for user decision.
 Thus, the characterization of phishing email properties by considering
 persuasion techniques in the real word analysis could fill the void to
 show to what extent do they involve in phishing emails.

Research goal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The main goal of this research is to characterize phishing email properties
 considering persuasive principles by finding the association between generic
 properties and persuasive principles.
 These generic properties consist of phishing email structural properties
 or features based on the literature survey findings.
 Each of these properties and each of the persuasive principle will be introduce
d as a variable in our methodology.
 We will look for frequency and relationship involving these variables.
 This relationship can be used to show new characteristics of phishing email
 properties considering the persuasive elements within its content.
 The characterization of phishing email considering persuasive principle
 also can be used to generate a new method in an automatic way of detecting
 phishing email as one of the primary delivery techniques of phishing attacks.

Research Questions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
To be able to meet the goal, we formulated two main research questions as
 follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang english
RQ1: What are the characteristics of reported phishing emails?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang english
RQ2: To what extent the persuasive principles are used in phishing emails?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several aspects of phishing email characteristics and hypotheses related
 to the research questions will be addressed in detail in

 Literature surveys and experimental exploration will be conducted in order
 to have a basic understanding concerning phishing in general.
 Furthermore, the data for the our analysis will be collected from security
 organization based in Netherlands which we can not disclose its identity.
 We are looking for reported phishing emails in 2013.
 We will be enumerating the outline our methodology into several steps:

 Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Data categorization will be determined by several aspects; languages (Dutch,
 English, others) and whether the email is indeed a phish, spam or legitimate.
 We predict there will be duplicated phishing emails so that we will only
 consider only unique email in our dataset.
 Structural properties of phishing emails will be reviewed in our literature
 survey and we will establish our variables based on these properties.
 Furthermore, the data classification phase will be indicated by our coding
 of the categorization result into these variables.
 The data will be analyzed from mainly three different viewpoints; properties
 characteristics, persuasion principles characteristics and their relationships.
 Lastly, we will look at how the findings answer our research questions.

\lang english
This research project is structured as follows: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Chapter 2 describes background and literature reviews about phishing in
 general.
 The subsections include; a general understanding of what is phishing in
 term of history and definition, an overview of its damage in term of money,
 an exploration of its modus operandi based on phishing stages or phases,
 a basic understanding of bad neighborhood and phishing, general phishing
 countermeasures and lastly the human factor in phishing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Experimental exploration with methods and results will be conducted in chapter

 differences of phishing website vs its original website.
 The methods and the results of the individual experiment will be presented
 in the respective sections.

 to support our research questions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 as the results of our analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Lastly, in chapter 6 we will present our discussion and conclusion of the
 research project, how the research questions are answered along with the
