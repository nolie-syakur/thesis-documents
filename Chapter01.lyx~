Problem statement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
With the enormous growing trends of information technology in modern generation,
 the evolution of digital era has become more mature in the sense of effectivene
ss and easiness for societies.
 Trusted entities such as financial institutions may offer their products
 and services to the public through the Internet.
 Consequently, societies are hoping to utilize technology advancement such
 as emails, websites, online payment system, social networks to achieve
 their tasks efficiently, affordable and more relevant.
 However, the advancement in information and communication technology has
 been a double-edged sword.
 It becomes easier to get personal information about someone in the cyber
 world.
 Cyber criminals see this opportunity as a way to manipulate consumers and
 exploit their confidential information such as usernames, passwords, bank
 account information, credit card or social security numbers.

One of the well known cyber crimes is called phishing.
 Phishing attacks aim to gain a financial benefit by masquerading legitimate
 institutions

.
 Moreover, phishing techniques may associated with fake emails and fake
 websites, however, the essence of this malicious behavior is the art of
 social engineering and deception

 i.e.
 how to trick the potential victims into disclosing their sensitive information.
 To illustrate one specific example; a phisher impersonates a well-known
 bank institutions and sends fake email announcing there is system upgrade
 to its customers, so the phisher would ask the customers to verify their
 usernames, passwords and credit card numbers in order to complete the system
 upgrade.
 In worst case, a clueless bank customer would have no idea and fail to
 ascertain that legitimate bank institutions would never ask for such things.
 Consequently, an unsuspecting victim might took the bait into divulging
 their sensitive information to the perpetrators.
 More concrete mechanism to carry out phishing attacks is that when the
 phishers send a large number of phishing emails which include malicious
 link or URL which redirect recepient to a fake website.
 A phishing email might be resembling a legitimate email so that unsuspecting
 victim might think that it is a genuine.
 By looking like a genuine email, it would help to circumvent the filtering
 system 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 One of phishing email methods is providing a malicious URL within its content,
 however, filtering systems of phishing email may have access to blacklist
 database of URLs that are currently being pushed, such as crowd sourced
 Phishtank.
 So the phishers might diverge the URL to bypass the matches.

\lang english
To make phishing email efficient, its context might require potential victim
 to urgently act upon it, for example an email informs about suspended account
 in a banking website.
 Phishing attacks are carried out using fake emails, fake websites and often
 phishers may exploit the end userâ€™s web browser to bypass warnings and
 URL information.
 In order to gain trust from receipent in a phishing email, persuasion technique
s are used to get a positive response from unsuspecting victim.
 Several countermeasures have been studied to detect phishing emails, such
 as the technique of looking for bit string that are previously determined
 as spams and phishing emails 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 The common characteristics of fake email sent by the phishers would be
 misleading hyperlinks and misleading header information 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, one of the non technical approach to defense against cyber
 fraud such as security awareness education to the public to ignore links
 within an email, even though the source of the email appear to be legitimate
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 However, current countermeasures within a phishing email so far do not
 consider psychoanalytic approach such as persuasion techniques, which it
 might be important for user decision.
 Thus, characterization and the relevancy of phishing email properties are
 needed, as well as the relevancy of persuasion techniques with these structural
 properties.

Research goal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The main goal of this research is characterization of phishing email properties
 by finding the association between generic properties and between persuasive
 principles with generic properties.
 These properties can be divided into several parts.
 Each of these parts and each of the persuasive principle will be introduced
 as a variable in our main analysis.
 We will look for relationship between these variables.
 This relationship can be used to show the characteristics and how relevant
 The integration of persuasive principles can be used to generate a new
 method of detecting phishing email as one of the primary delivery techniques
 of phishing attacks.

Research Questions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
To be able to meet the goal, we formulated two main research questions as
 follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang english
RQ1: What are the characteristics of reported phishing emails?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang english
RQ2: How relevant are the persuasive principles to the generic phishing
 email properties?
\end_layout

To answer our research questions, several aspects of phishing email characterist
ics and hypotheses will be established in

\lang english
This research project is structured as follows.
 Problem statement and research goal has been explained in chapter 1.
 Background and literature reviews will be discussed in chapter 2.
 Preliminary analyses will be conducted in chapter 3 along with preliminary
 methods and results.
 In chapter 4, we will explain more about our main research questions and
 hypotheses.
 In chapter 5, we will discuss our main data analysis and results.
 Lastly, in chapter 6 we will present our discussion and conclusion of the
 research project.
