To answer the second research question, we established 16 hypotheses to
 indicate the relationship between phishing email properties.
 We synthesize cialdini's principles with our dataset.
 In order to conduct synthesization, we established our decision making
 to classify which persuasive elements that are exist in a phishing email.
 This process will be explained in

In our coding of cialdini's principles and phishing email dataset, we identified
 phishing emails with fake logos and signatures that may mistakenly regard
 them as legitimate by average internet users.
 For example in the context of phishing email, signature such as

 It means that they have to provide information in a confident way.
 Consumers will have their doubt if sellers unsure and nervous when they
 offer their product and services to consumers.
 This principle has been one of the strategies in a social engineering attack

It is makes sense if government has the authority to compose laws and regulation
s and to control its citizens.
 Government sector includes court and police department also authorize to
 execute penalties if any wrongdoing happens within their jurisdiction.
 However, government may not have to be likeable to enforce their rules
 and regulation.
 Similarly, an administrator who control his network environment may behave
 in a similar fashion as government.
 Hence, in our dataset we hypothesize that

Similar to authority principle that may trigger reactance, scarce items
 and shortage may produce immediate compliance from people.
 In essence, people will react when their freedom is restricted about valuable
 matter when they think they are capable to make a choice among different
 options

 For example in phishing email context, an email from Royal Bank inform
 us that we have not been logged into our online banking account for a quite
 some time, as a security measure, they must suspend our online account
 and if we would like to continue to use the online banking facility, we
 have been asked to click the URL provided.
 Potential victim may perceives their online banking account as their valuable
 matter to access facility and information about their savings.
 Consequently, potential vicim may react to the request because of their
 account could be scarce and restricted.
 In the real world example, a hard worker bank customer who perceives money
 is a scarce item may immediately react when his bank inform him that he
 is in danger of losing his savings due to

As we describe in our decision making consideration section, people tend
 to trust those they like.
 In a context of persuasion, perpetrators may find it more difficult to
 portray physical attractiveness, instead they are relying on emails, websites
 and phone calling

 To exhibit charm or charisma to the potential victims, perpetrators may
 gain their trust by establishing friendly emails, affectionate websites
 and soothing voice over the phone.
 In the phishing email context, Amazon praises our existence in an appealing
 fashion and extremely values our account security so that no one can break
 it.
 Based on this scenario, E-commerce/Retails sector may applied likeability
 principles to gain potential customers.
 We therefore hypothesize that

For example, we tend to comply to a request when a social networking site
 asks us to visit a website or recommends something and mention that others
 have been visiting the website as well.

 This principle may lead to suggest the limitation on something that we
 deemed valuable.
 For example, a perpetrator masquerades as an authority and dressed as police
 officer halted us on the road, the perpetrator may tell us that we did
 something wrong and he will held our driving license if we do not pay him
 the fine.
 In the phishing email context, an email masquerades as

System Administrator

 may tell us that we exceeded our mailbox quota, so the administrator must
 freeze our email account and we could re-activate it by clicking the URL

 Based on this scenario, we know that it has authority principle and also
 has scarcity principle.
 Therefore, we hypothesize that

We often stumbled a group of people requesting to donate some of our money
 to the unfortunate people.
 Evidently, they would use physical attractiveness and kind words to get
 our commitment to support those people.
 Once they have got our commitment, they start asking for donation and we
 tend to grant their request and give some of our money to show that we
 are committed.
 Phishing email could be similar, for example, Paypal appreciates our membership
 on their system and PayPal kindly notifies us that in the membership term
 of agreement, they would performing annual membership confirmation from
 its customers.
 Based on this scenario, we know that the email has likeability principle
 and also has consistency principle.
 We would like to know if it is the case with phishing email in our dataset.
 Therefore, we hypothesize that

We think it make sense if a fraudster tries to make his fake product as
 genuine as possible and hide the fabricated element of his product.
 There are also fraudster that did not make his product as identical as
 the legitimate product.
 In the phishing email context, we perceives fake product as URL in the
 email, phishers do not necessarily obfuscates the real URL with something
 else.
 Logically, such phishers do not aim to make a high quality of bogus email,
 rather they aim to take chances in getting potential victims that are very
 careless.
 This leads to our hypothesis that say

It is conspicuous from our knowledge if a sales agent tries to sell us a
 product, it would be followed by the request element to buy the product
 as well.
 However, it will not make sense if he tries to sell his product but he
 requests to buy another company's product.
 In other words, if we have something to sell, we do not just display our
 product without asking people's attention to look at our product.
 For example in phishing email context, phishers may include URL or attachment
 in the body of the email and also they may request unsuspecting victim
 to click the URL or to open the attachment.
 This leads us to two hypotheses which state

We sometimes find it suspicious if a person dressed as police officer that
 does not have a badge carried with him, unless he is a fake police officer.
 Consequently, a fake police officer may use a fake badge to build up even

 Hence, we correlate that a person who wears police uniform and a fake badge
 in the real world context as authority principle and the precence of image
 in the phishing mail context.
 Another example, an email that masquerades Apple company, may clone Apple
 company logo or trademark to its content to increase the chance of potential

Apart from the target analysis, we also investigate the reason why potential

Similar from the hypothesis H14, it is sensible if a phishing email which
 contains account related reason such as reset password or security update,
 may tend to have a URL for the potential victim to be redirected towards
 phisher's bogus website or malware.
 Regardless of the target, based on our initial coding of the dataset we
 found that account related phishing emails need immediate action greater
 than other reasons.
 Therefore, phishers may likely to include a URL to have immediate response
 from the potential victim.
 This leads to our hypothesis that say
